This syndrome is associated with structural birth defects, including craniofacial defects and limb defects. The craniofacial defects include dolicocephaly, flat midface, and wide brow among others, although these characteristics have yet to be well characterized. This study characterized the craniofacial dysmorphology associated with PMS using a 3D surface imagining system to collect data on anatomical landmarks and generate dense surface models to evaluate variation. These standardized data collections methods allow for a precise understanding of the craniofacial defects associated with PMS. We examined PMS patients from across a wide age-range, which allowed us to develop an understanding of the impact of PMS on growth rates throughout the craniofacial complex and in comparison to control samples. The precise characterization of the craniofacial dysmorphologies is examined in conjunction with other clinical findings and genetic abnormalities. \n\n\nThis is restricted-access human data.

The 3dMD temporal system has capture speeds at ~1.5 milliseconds. This high capture speed compensates for any movements in the patient and is ideal for collecting data from children. The scanner was set-up at the Greenwood Genetics Center in Greenville to be used for continual data collection and the methods used to evaluate PMS.  In addition to data collection at the Greenwood Genetic Center, we traveled to the Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Foundation family conferences in Boston, MA, Columbia, SC, St. Roberts, MO, and Sydney Australia. We were scheduled to collect data at the international family conference which was unfortunately cancelled due to COVID. This sampling is opportunistic, although particular effort was focused on collecting scans from females and non-White ethnicities.Facial scanning using the 3dMD temporal scanning system were performed with standardized head positioning while the subject is seated, either alone or in the lap of a parent. The 3dMD system collects multiple scans at 10 frames per second and we examined a range of images to determine which image captures the patient in the proper orientation, most accurately, and with appropriate facial expression. The scanner captures a 190-degree view of the face from ear to ear in a single capture with six synchronized cameras.

Mice are useful for studying palate development because of their morphological and genetic similarities to humans. In mice, palate development occurs between embryonic days (E)11.5 to 15.5. Single cell transcriptional profiles of palate cell populations have been a valuable resource for the craniofacial research community, but we lack a single cell transcriptional profile for anterior palate at E13.5, at the transition from proliferation to shelf elevation.\n\n**Results**: A detailed single cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals heterogeneity in expression profiles of the cell populations of the E13.5 anterior palate. Hybridization chain reaction RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (HCR RNA FISH) reveals epithelial populations segregate into layers. Mesenchymal populations spatially segregate into four domains. One of these mesenchymal populations expresses ligands and receptors distinct from the rest of the mesenchyme, suggesting that these cells have a unique function. RNA velocity analysis shows two terminal cell states that contribute to either the proximal or distal palatal regions emerge from a single progenitor pool.\n\n**Conclusion**: This single cell resolution expression data and detailed analysis from E13.5 anterior palate provides a powerful resource for mechanistic insight into secondary palate morphogenesis for the craniofacial research community.\n\nMore details about the experiment can be found in the paper \"[Single cell sequencing of the mouse anterior palate reveals mesenchymal heterogeneity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36734036/)\" by Ozekin et al 2023.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":null,"release_date":"2023-11-13","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"48-EJN8 Mus palate (scRNA-seq) type single-cell assay C57BL/6 Bates hard RNA-seq 129 E13.5 Wild musculus Emily","RID":"48-EJN8","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b506963e-d274-11e5-99f0-67ee73dd4c3f","RMB":"https://auth.globus.org/b506963e-d274-11e5-99f0-67ee73dd4c3f","RCT":"2023-11-02T17:52:52.472915+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-13T18:20:33.852415+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/48-EJN8","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

These data were derived from the Longshanks source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Impacts of genetic correlation on the independent evolution of body mass and skeletal size in mammals:**\n\nMammals show a predictable scaling relationship between limb bone size and body mass. This relationship has a genetic basis which likely evolved via natural selection, but it is unclear how much the genetic correlation between these traits in turn impacts their capacity to evolve independently. Marchini et al. (2014) selectively bred laboratory mice for increases in tibia length independent of body mass, to test the hypothesis that a genetic correlation with body mass constrains evolutionary change in tibia length. Over 14 generations, the authors produced mean tibia length increases of 9-13%, while mean body mass was unchanged, in selectively bred mice and random-bred controls. Overall, results from this ongoing selection experiment suggest that parallel evolution of relatively longer hind limbs among rodents, for example in the context of strong competition for resources and niche partitioning in heterogeneous environments, may have occurred very rapidly on geological timescales, in spite of a moderately strong genetic correlation between tibia length and body mass.\n\n**(2) Artificial selection sheds light on developmental mechanisms of limb elongation:**\n\nSpecies diversity in limb lengths and proportions is thought to have evolved adaptively in the context of locomotor and habitat specialization, but the heritable cellular processes that drove this evolution within species are poorly understood. In this study, Marchini and Rolian (2018) take a novel “micro-evo-devo” approach, using artificial selection on relative limb length to amplify phenotypic variation in a population of mice, known as Longshanks, to examine the cellular mechanisms of postnatal limb development that contribute to intraspecific limb length variation. Cross-sectional growth data indicate that differences in bone length between Longshanks and random-bred controls are not due to prolonged growth, but to accelerated growth rates. Histomorphometric and cell proliferation assays on proximal tibial growth plates show that Longshanks’ increased limb bone length is associated with an increased number of proliferative chondrocytes. In contrast, the authors find no differences in other growth plate cellular features known to underlie interspecific differences in limb bone size and shape, such as the rates of chondrocyte proliferation or the size and number of hypertrophic cells in the growth plate. These data suggest that small differences among individuals in the number of proliferating chondrocytes are a potentially important determinant of selectable intraspecific variation in individual limb bone lengths, independent of body size.\n\n**(3) Selection for increased tibia length in mice alters skull shape through parallel changes in developmental mechanisms:**\n\nBones in the vertebrate cranial base and limb skeleton grow by endochondral ossification, under the control of growth plates. Mechanisms of endochondral ossification are conserved across growth plates, which increases covariation in size and shape among bones, and in turn may lead to correlated changes in skeletal traits not under direct selection. Unger et al. (2021) used micro-CT and geometric morphometrics to characterize shape changes in the cranium of the Longshanks mouse, which was selectively bred for longer tibiae. The authors show that Longshanks skulls became longer, flatter, and narrower in a stepwise process. Moreover, they show that these morphological changes likely resulted from developmental changes in the growth plates of the Longshanks cranial base, mirroring changes observed in its tibia. Thus, indirect and non-adaptive morphological changes can occur due to developmental overlap among distant skeletal elements, with important implications for interpreting the evolutionary history of vertebrate skeletal form.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nAll animal procedures have been approved by the Health Sciences Animal Care Committee at the University of Calgary (protocol AC13-0077). The mouse stock chosen for this artificial selection experiment was the Hsd-ICR (CD-1) stock, a general purpose outbred laboratory model. Mice derived from this stock have previously been used in artificial selection experiments. All mice were obtained from colonies A and B from barrier 217 at Harlan Biosciences (Indianapolis, IN), and each mouse came from different parents. Three closed lines of mice were set up, two experimental lines (the Longshanks mice) in which mice were selectively bred (Lines 1 and 2), and one control line in which mice were bred at random (Line C). In each line, 16 founding breeding pairs were established. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages (Greenline Sealsafe PLUS, Buguggiate, Italy), kept on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and a constant room temperature of 20°C, with food (Pico-Vac Mouse Diet 5061, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) and water provided ad libitum.\n\nIn each generation, after successful breeding, males were removed from the breeding pairs. Litters remained with their mothers until weaning at three weeks of age. Litter size was recorded, and male and female pups were then placed in separate cages with a maximum of five individuals per cage. At eight weeks old (+/− three days), all mice in Lines 1 and 2 were phenotyped and ranked within family to select the breeders for the following generation. The phenotypic assessment was performed as follows. Mice were anesthetized with a Ketamine/Xylazine solution (200 mg/10 mg per kg body mass), and weighed to the nearest 0.01 g.\n\nNext, breeders from each family were identified. The goal of the selective breeding protocol was to increase tibia length while maintaining body mass constant between the Longshanks and control mouse lines. Selecting for increases in tibia length independent of body mass ideally requires a regression-based approach, to identify individuals with the greatest positive residual tibia length after regressing on the cube root of body mass within sex. The relationship of body mass to tibia length in a given family was not always significant, however, because litter size, which varied from 2–18 individuals, and/or composition by sex, precluded the estimation of a linear regression within sex (e.g., some families had only 1–2 individuals of one sex). Instead, we used a ranking system in which males and females were ranked separately. Individuals were first ranked by absolute tibia length, and then again by relative tibial length, i.e., tibia length divided by (body mass)^0.33. The final rank of an individual was determined by summing the two ranks.\n\nThe top ranked male and female were selected as breeders. In the case of ties, the individual with the highest rank for relative tibia length was chosen as the breeder. The second highest ranked male and female from each family were also identified in case some families failed to produce litters within a generation. The breeders in a given family were paired randomly with breeders from two other families within an experimental line, i.e., disallowing sib mating and maximizing outbreeding. 16 pairs were set up each generation.\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. Whole-body scans of adults were acquired with a Skyscan 1173 v1.6 µCT scanner (Bruker, Kontich, Belgium) at 70–80 kV and 60–75 µA with 44.73 µm isotropic voxels and no filter.

These data were derived from the [International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium](http://www.mousephenotype.org). The IMPC data are available for sharing and adaptation under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium -- past and future perspectives on mouse phenotyping:**\n\nDetermining the function of all mammalian genes remains a major challenge for the biomedical science community in the 21st century. The goal of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) over the next 10 years is to undertake broad-based phenotyping of 20,000 mouse genes, providing an unprecedented insight into mammalian gene function. This short article explores the drivers for large-scale mouse phenotyping and provides an overview of the aims and processes involved in IMPC mouse production and phenotyping.\n\n**(2) The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium Web Portal, a unified point of access for knockout mice and related phenotyping data:**\n\nThe International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) web portal (http://www.mousephenotype.org) provides the biomedical community with a unified point of access to mutant mice and rich collection of related emerging and existing mouse phenotype data. IMPC mouse clinics worldwide follow rigorous highly structured and standardized protocols for the experimentation, collection and dissemination of data. Dedicated ‘data wranglers’ work with each phenotyping center to collate data and perform quality control of data. An automated statistical analysis pipeline has been developed to identify knockout strains with a significant change in the phenotype parameters. Annotation with biomedical ontologies allows biologists and clinicians to easily find mouse strains with phenotypic traits relevant to their research. Data integration with other resources will provide insights into mammalian gene function and human disease. As phenotype data become available for every gene in the mouse, the IMPC web portal will become an invaluable tool for researchers studying the genetic contributions of genes to human diseases.\n\n**(3) Disease model discovery from 3,328 gene knockouts by The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium:**\n\nAlthough next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the ability to associate variants with human diseases, diagnostic rates and development of new therapies are still limited by a lack of knowledge of the functions and pathobiological mechanisms of most genes. To address this challenge, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium is creating a genome- and phenome-wide catalog of gene function by characterizing new knockout-mouse strains across diverse biological systems through a broad set of standardized phenotyping tests. All mice will be readily available to the biomedical community. Analyzing the first 3,328 genes identified models for 360 diseases, including the first models, to our knowledge, for type C Bernard–Soulier, Bardet–Biedl-5 and Gordon Holmes syndromes. 90% of our phenotype annotations were novel, providing functional evidence for 1,092 genes and candidates in genetically uncharacterized diseases including arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia 3. Finally, we describe our role in variant functional validation with The 100,000 Genomes Project and others.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nThe IMPC uses a suite of targeting strategies that have different and complementary properties to produce knockout alleles. These strategies rely on the identification of a ‘critical’ exon common to all transcript variants that, when deleted, disrupts gene function. The mutant alleles may include additional functional features, such as a lacZ reporter cassette or conditional potential. Increasingly, the IMPC has been using CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout genes. Prior to this, gene knockout technology was based on ES cells. All mouse lines in this study were derived from IKMC ES cell resources. All mice were produced and maintained on a C57BL/6N genetic background, with support mice derived from C57BL/6NJ, C57BL/6NTac or C57BL/6NCrl. Husbandry details vary by centre, and can be found at http://www.mousephenotype.org/impress. For timed matings, successful mating and fertilization (0 h) was calculated to be the midpoint of the dark cycle before the appearance of the copulation plug.\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nEach embryo was subjected to hydrogel stabilization. Briefly, the embryo was incubated in 20 ml hydrogel solution containing a mixture of ice-cold 4% (wt) PFA, 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide (Bio-Rad), 0.05% (wt/vol) bis-acrylamide (Bio-Rad), 0.25% VA044 Initiator (Wako Chemicals USA), 0.05% (wt/vol) saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) and PBS at 4 °C for 3 days. After incubation, the tube containing the embryo was placed in a desiccation chamber where air in the tube was replaced with nitrogen gas. The tube was placed in a 37 °C water bath for 3 h. Lastly, the samples were separated from the encasing gel and placed into iodine solution. Each embryo was stained with 50 ml of 0.1 M iodine solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h. The iodine-stained embryo was then embedded in agarose in an 11-mm centrifuge tube and positioned in the micro-CT scanner for imaging.\n\n3D datasets were acquired for each mouse embryo using a Skyscan 1172 high-resolution micro-CT scanner (Bruker). Each specimen was rotated 360° around the vertical axis, generating 1200 views in 5 h, with the X-ray source set to 100 kVp and 100 μA and using a 0.5-mm aluminium filter. These image projections were reconstructed into digital cross-sections using the Feldkamp algorithm for cone beam CT. The resulting 3D data block contained resolutions ranging from 4 μm to 30 μm. To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space. In addition, many of the E15.5 images were subjected to a thresholding operation to remove background noise.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"Baiap2-/- Borcs8+/-

Tooth formation is a highly complex process that fine-tunes the size and shape of the tooth, which are crucial for its physiological functions. Each tooth consists of a crown and one or more roots. Despite comprehensive knowledge of the mechanism that regulates early tooth crown development, we have limited understanding of the mechanism regulating root patterning and size during development. Here we show that Ror2 mediated non-canonical Wnt signaling in the dental mesenchyme plays a critical role in cell proliferation and thereby regulates root development size in mouse molars. Furthermore, Cdc42 acts as a potential downstream mediator of Ror2 signaling in root formation. Importantly, activation of Cdc42 can restore cell proliferation and partially rescue the root development size defects in Ror2 mutant mice. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the function of Ror2-mediated non-canonical Wnt signaling in regulating tooth morphogenesis and suggest potential avenues for dental tissue engineering.

 {"id":14247,"accession":"FB00001002","title":"The Effect of Automated Landmark Identification on Morphometric Analyses Using the Collaborative Cross","project":316,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"Morphometric analysis of anatomical landmarks allows researchers to identify specific differences in craniofacial shape between natural populations or experimental groups, but manually identifying landmarks is time-consuming. Previous studies have shown that image registration based automated landmark identification may adequately replace manual landmarking in certain situations. We compare manually and automatically generated adult mouse skull landmarks and subsequent morphometric analyses to elucidate how switching from manual to automated landmarking will impact the morphometric analysis results for large mouse (Mus musculus) samples (n=1206) that represent wide “normal” phenotypic variation (54 genotypes). This large sample size allowed us to investigate how landmarking method impacts estimated differences in genotype mean shape, estimates of shape variance, and whether there were any genotype-specific biases in landmark identification. In addition, we tested whether an initial registration of specimen images to genotype specific averages improves automatic landmark identification accuracy. Our results indicated that automated landmark placement was significantly different than manual landmark placement, but that all methods identified similar patterns of skull shape covariation across our large sample. The addition of a preliminary genotype-specific registration step as part of a two-level procedure did not improve on the accuracy of one-level automatic landmark placement. The landmarks with the lowest automatic landmark accuracy are found in locations with poor image registration alignment. The most serious outliers within morphometric analysis of automated landmarks displayed instances of stochastic image registration error that are likely representative of errors common when applying image registration methods to µCT datasets that were initially collected with manual landmarking in mind. Additional efforts during specimen preparation and image acquisition can help reduce the number of registration errors and improve registration results. Previously identified tendencies of atlas-based registration methods to underestimate variation may reduce statistical power for tests designed to identify differences in variation or covariation patterns. For appropriate samples and research questions, our image registration based automated landmarking method can eliminate the time required for manual landmarking and identify similar general patterns of mean skull shape differences across a large genetically variable mouse sample. ","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"Our sample of 1206 mouse skull µCT images were previously acquired and manually landmarked for analysis of the genetic structure of “normal” laboratory mouse skull morphology. There are approximately twenty samples of eight inbred founder strains of the Collaborative Cross and 54 (of 56 possible) F1 crosses. Each cross is identified by two letters, the first being the maternal founder strain and the second being the paternal founder strain. For example, BB is a C57BL/6J founder and BC is a C57BL/6Jx129S1/SvlmJ F1 cross. Because all founder strains are inbred, specimens within each founder strain and F1 cross are isogenic. Strain identity is referred to as specimen genotype throughout the paper.\n\nµCT images were obtained in the 3D Morphometrics Centre at the University of Calgary with a Scanco vivaCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) at 0.035–0.038 mm voxel dimensions at 55 kV and 72–145 µA. The three-dimensional coordinates of 68 adult landmarks, as collected by a single expert observer from minimum threshold defined bone surfaces within ANALYZE 3D, represent the manually identified landmarks in our analysis. A second manual landmarking trial was completed more than four years after the first trial by the same observer on a representative subset of 100 specimens to quantify intra-observer landmark placement error.","release_date":"2018-11-26","show_in_jbrowse":false,"_keywords":"Mus analysis Benedikt Abnormal skull Marcucio bone S.

However, a majority of genomic variation studies have focused on single nucleotide variations (SNVs), with limited genome-wide analysis of CNVs in large cohorts, especially in populations that are under-represented in genetic studies including people of African descent. In this study, we carried out a genome-wide CNV analysis in > 3400 healthy Bantu Africans from Tanzania using high density (> 2.5 million probes) genotyping arrays. We identified over 400,000 CNVs larger than 1 kilobasepairs (kb), for an average of 120 CNVs per individual. Notably, we detected 4,823 CNVs in this cohort, which have not been reported previously. Further, we detected 866 large CNVs (> or =300 kb), which overlapped with genomic regions associated with multiple congenital anomaly syndromes, including Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome (Type1) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Furthermore, several of the common CNVs seen in our cohort (> or = 5 %) overlap with genes previously associated with developmental disorders. These findings may help to refine the phenotypic outcomes and penetrance of variations affecting genes and genomic regions previously implicated in diseases, mainly in people of European descent. Our study provides one of the largest datasets of CNVs from individuals of African ancestry, enabling improved clinical evaluation and disease-association of CNVs observed in research and clinical studies in African populations.\n\nThe dataset consists of two files: \n1. **Bantu_AllCNVs_Shaikh.xlsx**: which has all of our CNV data associated with encoded LabID and FaceBase ID. \n2. **Bantu_ID_decoder_Shaikh.xlsx**: which allows decoding the Sample and FaceBase ID into the Experimental ID in the dbGaP submission associated with this dataset.\n\nThis is restricted-access human data.

These data were derived from the Collaborative Cross (CC) source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) The Collaborative Cross, a community resource for the genetic analysis of complex traits:**\n\nThe goal of the Complex Trait Consortium is to promote the development of resources that can be used to understand, treat and ultimately prevent pervasive human diseases. Existing and proposed mouse resources that are optimized to study the actions of isolated genetic loci on a fixed background are less effective for studying intact polygenic networks and interactions among genes, environments, pathogens and other factors. The Collaborative Cross will provide a common reference panel specifically designed for the integrative analysis of complex systems and will change the way we approach human health and disease.\n\n**(2) The genome architecture of the Collaborative Cross mouse genetic reference population:**\n\nThe Collaborative Cross Consortium reports here on the development of a unique genetic resource population. The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a multiparental recombinant inbred panel derived from eight laboratory mouse inbred strains. Breeding of the CC lines was initiated at multiple international sites using mice from The Jackson Laboratory. Currently, this innovative project is breeding independent CC lines at the University of North Carolina (UNC), at Tel Aviv University (TAU), and at Geniad in Western Australia (GND). These institutions aim to make publicly available the completed CC lines and their genotypes and sequence information. The consortium genotyped, and report here, results from 458 extant lines from UNC, TAU, and GND using a custom genotyping array with 7500 SNPs designed to be maximally informative in the CC and used a novel algorithm to infer inherited haplotypes directly from hybridization intensity patterns. The authors identified lines with breeding errors and cousin lines generated by splitting incipient lines into two or more cousin lines at early generations of inbreeding. The consortium then characterized the genome architecture of 350 genetically independent CC lines. Results showed that founder haplotypes are inherited at the expected frequency, although we also consistently observed highly significant transmission ratio distortion at specific loci across all three populations. On chromosome 2, there is significant overrepresentation of WSB/EiJ alleles, and on chromosome X, there is a large deficit of CC lines with CAST/EiJ alleles. Linkage disequilibrium decays as expected and they saw no evidence of gametic disequilibrium in the CC population as a whole or in random subsets of the population. Gametic equilibrium in the CC population is in marked contrast to the gametic disequilibrium present in a large panel of classical inbred strains. Finally, the authors discuss access to the CC population and to the associated raw data describing the genetic structure of individual lines. Integration of rich phenotypic and genomic data over time and across a wide variety of fields will be vital to delivering on one of the key attributes of the CC, a common genetic reference platform for identifying causative variants and genetic networks determining traits in mammals.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nThe Collaborative Cross (CC) is a large panel of recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from a genetically diverse set of founder strains and designed specifically for complex trait analysis. It is a community effort that has generated a comprehensive body of genetic and physiological data derived from a common, reproducible and stable population. More specifically, the CC is a panel of eight-way RI strains that are independently derived from a mating scheme that minimizes unpredictable genomic interactions between strains and optimizes the contribution from each parental strain. The breeding design is efficient and modular: the genomes of eight founder strains are rapidly combined and are then inbred to produce finished RI strains. Eight-way RI strains achieve 99% inbreeding by generation 23. Each CC strain captures ∼135 unique recombination events. With genetic contributions from multiple parental strains, including several wild derivatives, the CC captures an abundance of genetic diversity and will retain segregating polymorphisms every 100–200 bp. This level of genetic diversity is sufficient to drive phenotypic diversity in almost any trait of interest. Such a large number of strains guarantees high mapping resolution and sample sizes sufficient for detecting extended networks of epistatic and gene-environment interactions.\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA). To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"NZOB6F1 B6WSBF1 PN79 PN133 NODAF1 NODB6F1 PN58 PN78 PN82 B6NZOF1 NODNZOF1 CASTNODF1 PWK/PhJ A129SF1 tomography A/J B6PWKF1 Hallgrimsson musculus PWKNZOF1 CASTWSBF1 WSBPWKF1 PWKAF1 PWKNODF1 NZOWSBF1 PN121 PWKB6F1 B6NODF1 PN74 WSBAF1 head WSBB6F1 C57BL/6J female B6CASTF1 micro-computed APWKF1 129SAF1 3-KB0W NOD/ShiLtJ NZOAF1 PN77 NZO/HlLtJ PWKWSBF1 PN72 129SPWKF1 male NZONODF1 PN230 PN60 PN85 ANZOF1 PN63 Mus PN94 Benedikt analysis PN86 PN71 B6AF1 CAST/EiJ WSB129SF1 WSBCASTF1 129SB6F1 PN70 (microCT) PN196 PN69 PN66 PN59 PN126 129SNZOF1 ACASTF1 PN80 ANODF1 PN131 Morphometric PN68 PN62 WSBNZOF1 B6129SF1 organism PN174 WSB/EiJ PN73 PWKCASTF1 CASTB6F1 PN76 CASTNZOF1 CASTAF1 PN61 PN65 NZO129SF1 CASTPWKF1 AB6F1 PN75 PN67 129S1/SvImJ 129SNODF1 PN81 NODWSBF1 AWSBF1 PN199 PN64 PWK129SF1 NODPWKF1 WSBNODF1 129SCASTF1","RID":"3-KB0W","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b4c06232-fced-4530-ba5e-a8fe378ac2a6","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2021-09-27T19:16:45.422803+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/3-KB0W","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

Treatment focuses on IDUA enzyme replacement and currently employed methods can be non-uniform in their efficacy particularly for the cardiac and craniofacial pathology. Therefore, Osborn et al. (2017) undertook efforts to better define the pathological cascade accounting for treatment refractory manifestations and demonstrate a role for the renin angiotensin system (RAS) using the IDUA−/− mouse model. Perturbation of the RAS in the aorta was more profound in male animals suggesting a causative role in the observed gender dimorphism and angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB) resulted in improved cardiac function. Further, the authors show the ability of losartan to prevent shortening of the snout, a common craniofacial anomaly in IDUA−/− mice. These data show a key role for the RAS in MPS associated pathology and support the inclusion of losartan as an augmentation to current therapies.\n\nThe MPS dataset is closely related to the RASopathy dataset.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nWildtype (WT) C57BL6 and IDUA−/− (C57BL6-MPS) (Clarke et al 1997) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Four groups of mice were employed. Group 1 consisted of adult IDUA −/− mice and age-matched WT male mice that underwent a single ultrasound examination between 7–8 months of age. In group 2, aortic arch tissue (male/female WT and male/female IDUA−/− ) was harvested and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Group 3 was comprised of adult IDUA−/− mice that were either untreated or treated with angiotensin receptor blockade. One untreated IDUA−/− mouse expired at 234 days and the remainder of the IDUA mice underwent elective sacrifice at mean ages of 341.8 or 292.3 days for treated or untreated groups, respectively. Group 4 consisted of juvenile mice in an ARB treatment trial that were segregated thusly: IDUA−/− and WT males receiving ARB; IDUA−/− and WT without treatment. Cardiac ultrasounds were performed on all mice prior to initiation of protocol and approximately every 6 weeks until elective sacrifice at 262 ± 9 days of age for IDUA−/− +/− ARB mice and 208 ± 4 days of age for WT mice, respectively. One spontaneous death occurred (IDUA−/− no ARB at age 138 days).\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA). To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"Mus PN336 PN366 analysis PN86 Benedikt PN183 (microCT) 3-KFBY PN305 PN104 tomography PN99 Morphometric Idua Hallgrimsson FACEBASE:3-VP6A musculus gene altered gene. null PN214 PN90 organism A https://www.facebase.org/id/3-VP6A type head lacks mutation PN274 micro-computed female product PN75 wild-type molecular PN72 male PN244 Idua-/- function PN85 PN152","RID":"3-KFBY","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b4c06232-fced-4530-ba5e-a8fe378ac2a6","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2021-09-28T18:23:21.357126+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/3-KFBY","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

 {"id":14469,"accession":"FB00001219","title":"Ghrhr: A standardized mouse morphology dataset for MusMorph","project":343,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"_This dataset contains processed micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available), all of which were generated for MusMorph. These data were derived from the Ghrhr source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Timing of growth hormone treatment affects trabecular bone microarchitecture and mineralization in growth hormone deficient mice:**\n\nGrowth hormone ([GH](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:95707)) is essential in the development of bone mass, and a growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in childhood is frequently treated with daily injections of GH. It is not clear what effect GHD and its treatment has on bone. Here, Kristensen et al. (2010) hypothesized that GHD would result in impaired microarchitecture, and an early onset of treatment would result in a better recovery than late onset. Growth hormone releasing hormone receptor [(Ghrhr)](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:95710) deficient homozygous (lit/lit) mice of both sexes were divided into two treatment groups receiving daily injections of GH, starting at an early (21 days of age) or a late time point (35 days of age, corresponding to the end of puberty). A group of heterozygous mice with normal levels of growth hormone served as controls. In vivo micro-computed tomography scans of the vertebrae (and, eventually, the crania) were obtained at five time points between 21 and 60 days of age, and trabecular morphology and volumetric BMD were analyzed to determine the effects of GH on bone microarchitecture. Early GH treatment led to significant improvements in bone volume ratio (p= 0.006), tissue mineral density (p= 0.005), and structure model index (p= 0.004) by the study endpoint (day 60), with no detected change in trabecular thickness. Trabecular number increased and trabecular separation decreased in GHD mice regardless of treatment compared to heterozygous mice. This suggests fundamental differences in the structure of trabecular bone in GHD and GH treated mice, reflected by an increased number of thinner trabeculae in these mice compared to heterozygous controls. There were no significant differences between the late treatment group and GHD mice except for connectivity density. Taken together, these results indicate that bone responds to GH treatment initiated before puberty but not to treatment commencing post-puberty, and that GH treatment does not rescue the structure of trabecular bone to that of heterozygous controls.\n\n**(2) Effects of growth hormone on the ontogenetic allometry of craniofacial bones:**\n\nOrganism size is controlled by interactions between genetic and environmental factors mediated by hormones with systemic and local effects. As changes in size are usually not isometric, a considerable diversity in shape can be generated through modifications in the patterns of ontogenetic allometry. In this study, Gonzalez et al. (2013) evaluated the role of timing and dose of growth hormone (GH) release on growth and correlated shape changes in craniofacial bones. Using a longitudinal study design, the authors analyzed GH deficient mice treated with GH supplementation commencing pre- and post-puberty. They obtained 3D in vivo micro-CT images of the skull between 21 and 60 days of age and used geometric morphometrics to analyze size and shape changes among control and GH deficient treated and non-treated mice. The variable levels of circulating GH altered the size and shape of the adult skull, and influenced the cranial base, vault, and face differently. While cranial base synchondroses and facial sutures were susceptible to either the direct or indirect effect of GH supplementation, its effect was negligible on the vault. Such different responses support the role of intrinsic growth trajectories of skeletal components in controlling the modifications induced by systemic factors. Contrary to the expected, the timing of GH treatment did not have an effect on catch-up growth. GH levels also altered the ontogenetic trajectories by inducing changes in their location and extension in the shape space, indicating that differences arose before 21 days and were further accentuated by a truncation of the ontogenetic trajectories in GHD groups.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nGhrhr homozygous ‘little’ mice (lit/lit) with a C57Bl/6 genetic background have impaired GH synthesis and release, although injection of exogenous GH can stimulate growth. Heterozygous mice (lit/+) have normal GH synthesis and release and are comparable to wild type C57Bl/6 mice. Mice used in this experiment were bred in-house from breeding pairs purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. At 21 days old, male and female pups were weaned and divided into one of six experimental groups: heterozygous (GH sufficient) control; homozygous (GH deficient) control; heterozygous radiation control; homozygous early treatment; homozygous late treatment; and homozygous saline injection control. Each group was composed of five male and five female mice, with the exception of the homozygous saline injection control group which consisted of three male and three female mice. Daily injections of 25 μg of mouse recombinant growth hormone (Dr. A.F. Parlow, National Hormone & Peptide Program) were administered subcutaneously to both the early and late treatment groups. The protocol of Grosebeck et al. was adapted for the preparation of the GH. Growth hormone was initially solubilized in a solution of 0.03 M NaHCO3 in 0.15 M NaCl adjusted to pH 10.8 and stored at −20 °C for a maximum of two weeks. On the day of use, the solution was diluted to a volume of 25 μL with 0.03 M NaHCO3 in 0.15 M NaCl and pH was adjusted to 9.5. Daily treatment began at 21 days of age for the early treatment group, and at 35 days of age for the late treatment group. These time points are consistent with other studies in the Ghrhr mouse model, with age 21 days being equivalent to the commencement of treatment before puberty, while the 35 day late injection time point is the equivalent to the end of puberty as vaginal opening has been reported to occur by this day in GH receptor knockout mice [17,22,23]. In C57Bl/6 mice, vaginal opening occurs by day 31. The injection control mice received daily subcutaneous injections of saline starting at 21 days of age to determine if there were effects of stress from daily injections. All injections ceased at 60 days of age.\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA). To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"Mus analysis Benedikt PN86 Ghrhr-/- PN21 3-KB08 (microCT) PN78 PN82 tomography PN35 Ghrhr Ghrhr+/- Morphometric PN45 Hallgrimsson PN28 FACEBASE:3-VP6A musculus gene altered gene. null organism A https://www.facebase.org/id/3-VP6A type head lacks mutation micro-computed female product PN81 wild-type molecular male function PN60 PN87","RID":"3-KB08","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b4c06232-fced-4530-ba5e-a8fe378ac2a6","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2021-09-27T18:27:14.104381+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/3-KB08","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

However, the mechanism regulating tooth root patterning and development is largely unknown. In this study, we provide the first in vivo evidence demonstrating that Ezh2 in the dental mesenchyme determines patterning and furcation formation during dental root development in mouse molars. Mechanistically, an antagonistic interaction between epigenetic regulators Ezh2 and Arid1a controls Cdkn2a expression in the dental mesenchyme to regulate dental root patterning and development. These findings indicate the importance of balanced epigenetic regulation in determining the tooth root pattern and the integration of roots with the jaw bones to achieve physiological function.

In multiple organs, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) give rise to transit amplifying cells (TACs), which then differentiate into different cell types. However, whether and how MSCs interact with TACs remains unknown. Using the adult mouse incisor as a model, we present in vivo evidence that TACs and MSCs have distinct genetic programs and engage in reciprocal signaling cross talk to maintain tissue homeostasis. Specifically, an IGF-WNT signaling cascade is involved in the feedforward from MSCs to TACs. TACs are regulated by tissue-autonomous canonical WNT signaling and can feedback to MSCs and regulate MSC maintenance via Wnt5a/Ror2-mediated non-canonical WNT signaling. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of coordinated bidirectional signaling interaction between MSCs and TACs in instructing mesenchymal tissue homeostasis, and the mechanisms identified here have important implications for MSC–TAC interaction in other organs.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"Incisor samples from LCM of 1-month-old Axin2-CreERT2;Rosa26<fs-tdTomato> and Gli1-CreERT2;Rosa26<fs-tdTomato> mice were collected for RNA isolation using an RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN).

These data were derived from the Hybrid source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Craniomandibular form and body size variation of first generation mouse hybrids -- a model for hominin hybridization:**\n\nHybridization occurs in a number of mammalian lineages, including among primate taxa. Analyses of ancient genomes have shown that hybridization between our lineage and other archaic hominins in Eurasia occurred numerous times in the past. However, there are still limited empirical data on what a hybrid skeleton looks like, or how to spot patterns of hybridization among fossils for which there are no genetic data. Here, Warren et al. (2018) use experimental mouse models to supplement previous studies of primates. The authors characterize size and shape variation in the cranium and mandible of three wild-derived inbred mouse strains and their first generation (F1) hybrids. The three parent taxa in our analysis represent lineages that diverged over approximately the same period as the human/Neanderthal/Denisovan lineages and their hybrids are variably successful in the wild. Comparisons of body size, as quantified by long bone measurements, are also presented to determine whether the identified phenotypic effects of hybridization are localized to the cranium or represent overall body size changes. The results indicate that hybrid cranial and mandibular sizes, as well as limb length, exceed that of the parent taxa in all cases. All three F1 hybrid crosses display similar patterns of size and form variation. These results are generally consistent with earlier studies on primates and other mammals, suggesting that the effects of hybridization may be similar across very different scenarios of hybridization, including different levels of hybrid fitness. This paper serves to supplement previous studies aimed at identifying F1 hybrids in the fossil record and to introduce further research that will explore hybrid morphologies using mice as a proxy for better understanding hybridization in the hominin fossil record.\n\n**(2) Hybridization in human evolution -- insights from other organisms:**\n\nDuring the late Pleistocene, isolated lineages of hominins exchanged genes thus influencing genomic variation in humans in both the past and present. However, the dynamics of this genetic exchange and associated phenotypic consequences through time remain poorly understood. Gene exchange across divergent lineages can result in myriad outcomes arising from these dynamics and the environmental conditions under which it occurs. Here, Ackermann et al. (2019) draw from research across various organisms, illustrating some of the ways in which gene exchange can structure genomic/phenotypic diversity within/among species. The authors present a range of examples relevant to questions about the evolution of hominins. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather illustrative of the diverse evolutionary causes/consequences of hybridization, highlighting potential drivers of human evolution in the context of hybridization including: influences on adaptive evolution, climate change, developmental systems, sex-differences in behavior, Haldane's rule and the large X-effect, and transgressive phenotypic variation.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nThis dataset comprises mice from three wild-derived inbred M. musculus strains (M. m. casteneus [CAST/EiJ, hereafter CAS], M. m. musculus [CZECHI/EiJ, hereafter CZE], and M. m. domesticus [WSB/EiJ, hereafter WSB]), acquired from the Jackson Laboratory (www.jax.org), and their F1 hybrids (CASTxCZE, CASTxWSB, and CZExWSB; all crosses were reciprocal).

 {"id":14476,"accession":"FB00001225","title":"Brain-Face: A standardized mouse morphology dataset for MusMorph","project":343,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"_This dataset contains processed micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available), all of which were generated for MusMorph. These data were derived from the Brain-Face source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Short-faced mice and developmental interactions between the brain and the face:**\n\nThe length of the face represents an important axis of variation in mammals and especially in primates. Mice with mutations that produce variation along this axis present an opportunity to study the developmental factors that may underlie evolutionary change in facial length. The [Crf4](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:2671562) mutant, obtained from the C57BL/6J (wt/wt) background by chemical mutagenesis by the Baylor Mouse Mutagenesis Resource, is reported to have a short-faced phenotype. As an initial step towards developing this model, Boughner et al. (2008) performed 3D geometric morphometric comparisons of Crf4 mice to C57BL/6J wild-type mice focusing on three stages of face development and morphology – embryonic (E10.5–11.5), neonatal, and adult. Morphometric analysis of adult Crf4 mutants revealed that in addition to a shortened face, these mice exhibit a significant reduction in brain size and basicranial length. These same features also differ at the neonatal stage. During embryonic face formation, only dimensions related to brain growth were smaller, whereas the Crf4 face actually appeared advanced relative to the wild-type at the same somite stage. These results show that aspects of the Crf4 phenotype are evident as early as embryonic face formation. Based on their anatomical findings, the authors hypothesize that the reduction in facial growth in Crf4 mice is a secondary consequence of reduction in the growth of the brain. If correct, the Crf4 mutant will be a useful model for studying the role of epigenetic interactions between the brain and face in the evolutionary developmental biology of the mammalian craniofacial complex as well as human craniofacial dysmorphology.\n\n**(2) Epigenetic integration of the developing brain and face:**\n\nThe integration of the brain and face and to what extent this relationship constrains or enables evolutionary change in the craniofacial complex is an issue of long-standing interest in vertebrate evolution. To investigate brain-face integration, Parsons et al. (2011) studied the covariation between the forebrain and midface at gestational days 10–10.5 in four strains of laboratory mice. The authors found that phenotypic variation in the forebrain is highly correlated with that of the face during face formation such that variation in the size of the forebrain correlates with the degree of prognathism and orientation of the facial prominences. This suggests strongly that the integration of the brain and face is relevant to the etiology of midfacial malformations such as orofacial clefts. This axis of integration also has important implications for the evolutionary developmental biology of the mammalian craniofacial complex.\n\n**(3) Mechanisms that underlie co-variation of the brain and face:**\n\nThe effect of the brain on the morphology of the face has long been recognized in both evolutionary biology and clinical medicine. In this work, Marcucio et al. (2011) describe factors that are active between the development of the brain and face and how these might impact craniofacial variation. First, there is the physical influence of the brain, which contributes to overall growth and morphology of the face through direct structural interactions. Second, there is the molecular influence of the brain, which signals to facial tissues to establish signaling centers that regulate patterned growth. Importantly, subtle alterations to these physical or molecular interactions may contribute to both normal and abnormal variation. These interactions are therefore critical to our understanding of how a diversity of facial morphologies can be generated both within species and across evolutionary time.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nHomozygous Crf4 (crf4/crf4) male and female mice were obtained from the Baylor Mouse Mutagenesis Resource (http://www.mouse-genome.bcm.tmc.edu/ENU/ENUMutantSources.asp). The short-faced Crf4 mutant was developed on the C57BL/6J (wt/wt) (Jackson Labs) background by chemical induction through N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis (Kile et al. 2003). Although the gene or genes involved remain undefined, the Crf4 mutation is a non-lethal, recessive mutation located on chromosome 13 (MGI:3026658). The Crf4 mice are also heterozygous for a 24CM inversion on chromosome 11 (Kile et al. 2003). This inversion, representing about 2% of the mouse genome, is derived from 129/SvEv mice and may thus contain unknown genetic variants that exert dominant or semi-dominant effects on craniofacial morphology.\n\nHomozygous Kcna1 (megencephaly) mutants (mixed C57BL/6J;Balb/C background) were acquired from the Jackson Laboratory. They have 25% expanded but normally shaped brains from generalized neural cell hypertrophy generated by a single recessive autosomal mutation, an 11 bp deletion in the Kcna1 gene (Diez et al. 2003; Petersson et al. 2003). Individuals were genotyped by PCR (primers: TTG TGT CGG TCA TGG TCA TC [forward], GCC CAG GGT AAT GAA ATA AGG [reverse]), and gel bands were sequenced for a subsample due to the small difference between fragment lengths. \n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA). To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"Mus analysis Benedikt PN93 PN88 (microCT) Kcna1-/-;Crf4NA PN98 PN103 tomography Kcna1NA;Crf4NA Morphometric PN97 Hallgrimsson FACEBASE:3-VP6A musculus gene Crf4-/- PN95 null altered gene.

In the US, the prevalence in adults is approximately 90% (Beltran-Aguilar et al., 2005), and in some high-risk populations, the prevalence is even higher. Treatment of dental caries consumes significant resources each year, and untreated caries lesions can lead to pain, tooth loss, and oral infection, or other co-morbidities. Cariogenesis is affected my numerous environmental, behavioral, and genetic factors, including dietary behaviors, bacterial flora, fluoride exposure, salivary factors, tooth morphology, etc. (Hunter, 1988; Anderson, 2002).\n\nThis study of dental caries focuses on caries in permanent dentition in adults. Five independent samples were included from the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia (COHRA), the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine Dental Registry and DNA Repository (DRDR1, DRDR2), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS).

To account for variation in total number of teeth at risk (due to an older sample of individuals), a new phenotype (proportion DFS) was created for analysis where the proportion of DFS equals the DFS counts divided by the total number of surfaces at risk.\n\nHPFS:\nCaries were assessed by self-reported questionnaires on the total number of cavities in permanent teeth.\n\nAnalysis Methods:\nGWAS scans were performed separately in each sample in PLINK using linear regression while adjusting for age and sex as covariates.

Using unbiased single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data analysis combined with mouse genetic approaches, we identified TGF-β signaling as the predominant signaling activity that enables the perimysial cells to interact with the adjacent myogenic cells during late pharyngeal muscle development. Furthermore, we identified that perimysial-specific regulator Creb5 interacts specifically with TGF-β signaling to co-activate the expression of specific perimysial-to-myogenic signals such as Fgf18 to regulate pharyngeal myogenesis.

These data were derived from the Nosip source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Mapping the multi-modal distribution of craniofacial phenotypes in NOSIP mutants:**\n\nNitric Oxide Synthase Interacting Protein ([NOSIP](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:1913644)) is a E3 mono-ubiquitin ligase that regulates the activity of protein phosphatase 2A. Deletion of NOSIP leads to severe and variable malformations of the craniofacial complex. Our goal was to use NOSIP mutant mice to understand of mechanisms of phenotypic variation. The phenotype of an individual embryo is the product of the developmental trajectory that it previously traversed. Richbourg et al. (2020) propose that this concept of canalization is essential for understanding the etiology of complex phenotypic outcomes. The authors have previously shown that the brain patterns the face, so sequential perturbations affecting the brain and face may create unique developmental trajectories that each embryo transits. Richbourg and colleagues tested this by creating a 3D morphospace of NOSIP heterozygous and homozygous mutants to determine if embryos occupy unique morphospace regions based on affected craniofacial structures. Embryos between embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) to E17.5 were collected, fixed, and imaged (mCT). NOSIP expression appears to be restricted to the neuroepithelium, lower jaw mesenchyme, and mesenchyme and epithelium in tissue adjacent to the frontonasal ectodermal zone between stage E10.5-11.5. Embryos with a single telencephalic lobe had more severe facial malformations, including micrognathia and obstructed airway without significant changes in early cell apoptosis (via TUNEL staining). Embryos with normal telencephalic vesicle separation had less severe facial phenotypes, including left-right mild asymmetry and clefting. Overall, it appears that NOSIP-KO creates a multi-modal distribution of craniofacial phenotypes along the developmental timeline by affecting early brain development, suggesting that understanding canalization may provide insight into the complexity of genotype-phenotype map.\n\nNote that this [dataset](https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.03658) is currently unpublished but in review.

Although many candidate genes have been identified, the regulation and interaction of these genes in CL/P remain unclear. In addition, the contribution of microRNAs (miRNAs), non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of multiple genes, to the etiology of CL/P is largely unknown.\n\n**METHODS:**\nTo identify the signatures of causative biological pathways for human CL/P, we conducted a systematic literature review for human CL/P candidate genes and subsequent bioinformatics analyses. Functional enrichment analyses of the candidate CL/P genes were conducted using the pathway databases GO and KEGG. The miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of the CL/P candidate genes was analyzed with miRanda, PITA, and TargetScan, and miRTarbase. Genotype-phenotype association analysis was conducted using GWAS. The functional significance of the candidate miRNAs was evaluated experimentally in cell proliferation and target gene regulation assays in human lip fibroblasts.\n\n**RESULTS:**\nThrough an extensive search of the main biomedical databases, we mined 177 genes with mutations or association/linkage reported in individuals with CL/P, and considered them as candidate genes for human CL/P. The genotype-phenotype association study revealed that mutations in 12 genes (ABCA4, ADAM3A, FOXE1, IRF6, MSX2, MTHFR, NTN1, PAX7, TP63, TPM1, VAX1, and WNT9B) were significantly associated with CL/P. In addition, our bioinformatics analysis predicted 16 microRNAs (miRNAs) to be post-transcriptional regulators of CL/P genes. To validate the bioinformatics results, the top six candidate miRNAs (miR-124-3p, miR-369-3p, miR-374a-5p, miR-374b-5p, miR-497-5p, and miR-655-3p) were evaluated by cell proliferation/survival assays and miRNA-gene regulation assays in cultured human lip fibroblasts. We found that miR-497-5p and miR-655-3p significantly suppressed cell proliferation in these cells. Furthermore, the expression of the predicted miRNA-target genes was significantly downregulated by either miR-497-5p or miR-655-3p mimic.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nExpression of miR-497-5p and miR-655-3p suppresses cell proliferation through the regulation of human CL/P-candidate genes. This study provides insights into the role of miRNAs in the etiology of CL/P and suggests possible strategies for the diagnosis of CL/P.\n\n**REFERENCE DATABASES:**\n- [http://geneontology.org](http://geneontology.org)\n- [https://www.genome.jp/kegg](https://www.genome.jp/kegg)\n","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Data sources**\nThe publishing guidelines set forth by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses) were followed during the literature search and review. The search was conducted using three main literature databases: Medline (Ovid), PubMed (NLM), and Embase (Ovid). In addition, related citations were searched in Scopus (Elsevier, Inc.) to check whether any unique studies were missed from the regular database searches. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the linked publication.\n\n**Bioinformatics analysis of CL/P genes**\nFunctional enrichment analyses of the candidate genes were conducted using the pathway databases Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) through tools of the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID, version 6.8, http://david.ncifcrf.gov) [18]. The enrichment of CL/P genes in a pathway or GO term was tested by the hypergeometric test implemented in DAVID. The p-values were adjusted by false discovery rate (FDR, q-value). The significant pathways were obtained by q < 0.05 and at least four genes from the list of input genes (CL/P genes) in each pathway included. Hierarchical level 4 was used as the cutoff in order to avoid too general GO terms. The miRNA- mediated post-transcriptional regulation of the CL/P candidate genes was analyzed by using the following method: first, the miRNA-gene pairs were identified from three computationally predicted miRNA-target gene interaction databases, miRanda, PITA, and TargetScan [Chou et al., 2016. PMID: 26590260; John et al., 2004. PMID: 15502875; Kertesz et al., 2007. PMID: 17893677; Lewis et al., 2005. PMID: 15652477]; then, the miRNA-gene pairs that were experimentally proofed were selected through miRTarbase analysis [Jiang et al., 2016. PMID: 26655252]; finally, for each miRNA, the enrichment of CL/P candidate genes was examined using Fisher’s Exact Test. To investigate which human phenotype terms are strongly enriched for the candidate genes, the WEB-based Gene SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) (http://webgestalt.org) was used to perform the overrepresentation enrichment analysis (OEA) using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) annotation database. The top 30 results from the OEA were retrieved on March 15, 2019. The minimum number of genes per category was set to 5 (default). The Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used for multiple test correction [Yoav et al., 2005]. FDR values were used for all statistical analyses.\n\n**Genotype-phenotype association analysis**\nGenotype-phenotype association analysis was conducted using GWAS available from dbGaP (dbGaP accession phs000774.v1.p1, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap). This dbGaP repository includes 11,925 individuals from 4058 families, mostly from trios. Out of 11,925 individuals, 5327 were reported as Caucasians, 2221 as Asians, 473 as Africans, and 3904 were reported as having more than one ancestry. A total of 5008 individuals were reported as of Hispanic ethnicity. Not including the parents, 52% of children were males and 48% were females. Array-based genotypes from Illumina Infinium HumanCore Beadchips, including GWAS markers from HumanCore v1 with additional exome and custom contents from the Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics (CCDG) consortium, were analyzed with the PLINK software (version 1.90b) to test the association of each directly genotyped variant in the genes listed through the systematic review. Transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was applied for maximizing analytical power for trios and for minimizing artifacts from population stratification.","release_date":"2020-07-07","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"data TPM1 analysis sapiens ADAM3A MSX2 FOXE1 Iwata NTN1 lip Junichi Homo MTHFR VAX1 Abca4 1-JVRW IRF6 Wnt9b secondary PAX7 TP63","RID":"1-JVRW","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/bdbab89d-1104-40b1-9f2f-33eeef1a3a6d","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2020-05-18T17:29:51.817732+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/1-JVRW","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

We initiated imaging at multiple time points between E14.75 and E15.5 in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of epithelial behaviors during MES removal. First, by live imaging the mid-anterior MES beginning at E14.75, we observed initial small breaks in the epithelium that enlarged as surrounding epithelial cells underwent rearrangements, breaking and re-establishing epithelial junctions until coalescing into a network of trails. We noticed extensive MES cell blebbing, consistent with the occurrence of apoptosis. Live imaging beginning at E15.5 revealed that epithelial trails streamed continuously toward the surface epithelium. During their migration, epithelial trails often broke into smaller cell collectives, forming epithelial islands. When epithelial islands were close to the surface epithelium, they ultimately contacted and coalesced with the oral or nasal surface epithelium. However, epithelial islands that were deep within the secondary palatal shelves exhibited apoptotic bodies and membrane blebbing as they progressively disappeared through apparent cell death over the course of imaging\nGiven that the MES was successfully removed in the absence of cell death, but that patterns of epithelial removal were altered, we performed live imaging of _Baxlox/lox; Bak−/−; CrectTg/0; R26mTmG/+_ embryos to observe whether the cell behaviors underlying MES removal were altered upon loss of apoptosis. Epithelial breakage and collective migration of epithelial trails in mutants appeared overtly similar to those in control embryos at E15.5. In addition, we observed reclosure of some epithelial breaks that we did not see in wild-type embryos. Epithelial islands in mutants underwent cell blebbing similar to control but failed to shrink or disappear in the imaging timeframe. These persistent epithelial islands together with occasional recovery of epithelial breakage may account for the mildly altered epithelial removal seen in _ Baxlox/lox; Bak−/−; CrectTg/0_ mutants. These results indicate that in the absence of apoptosis, MES cells retain collective epithelial migration behaviors that compensate for the loss of apoptotic contributions to MES removal.\n\nNote: The data files in this dataset are in CZI format which is a Zeiss proprietary imaging format.

Blocks were sectioned in ice-cold DMEM/F12 media to 250 µm slices using a Leica CT1000S vibratome. Regions of interest were confirmed by visualization of the endogenous EGFP reporter on a spinning disk confocal microscope. Sections were laid flat in a 35 mm No. 1.0 uncoated glass bottom dish (MatTek) and embedded in a mixture of agarose and culture media [20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 200 µg/ml L-ascorbic acid to Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F12 media (Gibco DMEM/F12 without Phenol Red)]. This mixture was made by adding 3.5% low-melting agarose immediately prior to embedding, to a final concentration of 0.6%. Sagittal live imaging of the MES was performed using a Zeiss Cell Observer spinning disk confocal microscope or a Zeiss LSM900 laser scanning confocal equipped with a 37°C incubation chamber. Time-lapse images were captured with 488 nm laser excitation for approximately 24 h at 15-min intervals. In these experiments, investigators were blinded to genotype (if applicable) until after completion of imaging.

Using the mouse soft palate as a model, we performed an unbiased single-cell RNA-seq analysis to investigate the heterogeneity and lineage commitment of CNC derivatives during craniofacial muscle development. We show that Runx2, a known osteogenic regulator, is expressed in the CNC-derived perimysial and progenitor populations. Loss of Runx2 in CNC-derivatives results in reduced expression of perimysial markers (Aldh1a2 and Hic1) as well as soft palate muscle defects in Osr2-Cre;Runx2fl/fl mice. We further reveal that Runx2 maintains perimysial marker expression through suppressing Twist1, and that myogenesis is restored in Osr2-Cre;Runx2fl/fl;Twist1fl/+ mice.

Specimens were silver-stained using the contrast agent methods described in Raj et al. 2014 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24357499/). Details of this method are also reported in Ko et al. 2021 (LINK), as well as described as follows:\n\nWe collected specimens from our colony of C57BL/6J inbred wild-type mice (stock #000664, Jackson Laboratories). Mice were managed under ethics permit #20110008 in compliance with Canada Council on Animal Care and University of Saskatchewan regulations. The morning that a vaginal plug was first visible was considered E0.5, which we used to calculate dates of sacrifice and embryo collection. Embryonic stage was determined by tail somite number as well as by limb and craniofacial morphologies as per conventional Theiler staging[31]. Postnatal specimens were collected at ages based on day of birth (P0). We collected specimens aged E10 to P32 (n≤3 specimens/stage, Table 1). As detailed in Raj et al.[27], specimens were 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed, then dehydrated through graded ethanol washes. One day before scanning, specimens were stained overnight with a 1% solution of Protargol (Polysciences; Sigma) tissue contrast agent. Prior to staining, the heads of mice aged P3 and older were cut in half along the sagittal plane to improve stain penetration through skin and bone.\n\nAt the Canadian Light Source synchrotron (Saskatoon, SK), on the BioMedical Imaging &amp; Therapy 05B1-1 beamline, we µCT scanned specimens, at 8.75-8.9µm voxel size. using the following parameters: filtered white beam, 4.0 mm aluminum filter, 0.5 mm tin filter, Hamamatsu C9300 camera combined with beam monitor Hamamatsu AA-60. For each scan, a dark field was used to correct for electronic noise, in addition to being used with a flat field to correct for inhomogeneous beam intensity over time. \n\nHCImage software (Hamamatsu) was used to normalize each experimental scan to the dark and flatfields. These normalized scan files were imported into NRecon software (Bruker MicroCT). Here images were reconstructed and optimized via standard protocols to adjust clarity, contrast, and saturation in the region of interest (ROI). Adjustments included misalignment compensation and ring artefact reduction.\nNext, the digital-format µCT scan files were imported into AMIRA software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) to generate 3D volumes, and visualize craniodental developmental morphology and anatomy.","release_date":"2021-06-07","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"Julia E11.5 E10.0 face PN21 papilla 1-YBZ6 imaging assay process 3 enamel cingulum tomography E13.5 Wild mandible musculus mandibular embryonic odontogenic No Boughner E10.5 2 PN18 ridge description PN6 PN12 arch head micro-computed C57BL/6J PN15 PN32 Molar Type E17.5 retromolar Mus molariform space E12.5 organ (microCT) pulp FACEBASE:1-4FPW molar premaxilla 1st dental E14.5 lower PN28 PN8 PN26 jaw incisor maxillary-mandibular https://www.facebase.org/id/1-4FPW lamina maxillary E15.5 type upper cleft root E16.5 epithelium PN0 central component crown tooth microscopy PN23 alveolar maxilla PN3 PN30 E18.5 1","RID":"1-YBZ6","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b506963e-d274-11e5-99f0-67ee73dd4c3f","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2021-02-10T21:31:45.122541+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/1-YBZ6","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

However, the functional significance of Dlx5 in patterning the oropharyngeal region has remained unknown. Here we show that loss of Dlx5 leads to a shortened soft palate and an absence of the levator veli palatini, palatopharyngeus, and palatoglossus muscles that are derived from the 4th pharyngeal arch (PA), but the tensor veli palatini, derived from the 1st PA, is unaffected. Dlx5-positive cranial neural crest (CNC) cells are in direct contact with myoblasts derived from the pharyngeal mesoderm, and Dlx5 disruption leads to altered proliferation and apoptosis of CNC and muscle progenitor cells. Collectively, our results indicate that Dlx5 plays critical roles in patterning of the oropharyngeal region and development of muscles derived from the 4th PA mesoderm in the soft palate, likely via interactions between CNC-derived and myogenic progenitor cells.\n\nThe counts data file corresponding to this dataset can be obtained from GEO following the link given in the Related Datasets section below.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"We performed transcriptome profiling of Dlx5-/- and littermate control mice at E14.5 to analyze differentially expressed genes.

Following individual cells of a trail from the middle palate revealed that, although some rearrangements occurred within epithelial streams, the nuclei moved collectively from positions deeper within the seam to the oral epithelium. Although the paths of some cells in an epithelial trail were more tortuous than the paths of others, this was not dependent on the distance away from the oral epithelium. Although many epithelial islands appeared to resolve through apoptosis, individual cells of a larger island from the anterior palate exhibited collective movement toward the oral epithelium. Following individual cells revealed similar tortuous paths to the epithelium, with cells deeper within the mesenchyme traversing a similar path to cells closer to the epithelium.\n\nNote: The data files in this dataset are in CZI format which is a Zeiss proprietary imaging format.

Embryo heads were dissected and the top of the head, calvaria primordia and lower jaw were removed in ice-cold PBS. The remaining tissue, including the maxillae, was embedded in 5% low-melt agarose. Blocks were sectioned in ice-cold DMEM/F12 media to 250 µm slices using a Leica CT1000S vibratome. Regions of interest were confirmed by visualization of the endogenous EGFP reporter on a spinning disk confocal microscope. Sections were laid flat in a 35 mm No. 1.0 uncoated glass bottom dish (MatTek) and embedded in a mixture of agarose and culture media [20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 200 µg/ml L-ascorbic acid to Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F12 media (Gibco DMEM/F12 without Phenol Red)]. This mixture was made by adding 3.5% low-melting agarose immediately prior to embedding, to a final concentration of 0.6%. Sagittal live imaging of the MES was performed using a Zeiss Cell Observer spinning disk confocal microscope or a Zeiss LSM900 laser scanning confocal equipped with a 37°C incubation chamber. Time-lapse images were captured with 488 nm laser excitation for approximately 24 h at 15-min intervals.

Oral clefts have a complex and heterogeneous etiology, with strong evidence for both genetic and environmental causal factors. Candidate gene studies and genome wide linkage studies have yielded compelling but inconsistent evidence that multiple genes control risk, and several studies have shown evidence for interaction between genes and environmental exposures, especially maternal smoking and nutrient intake. This consortium assembled a large collection of cases and their parents from multiple populations for genome wide association studies as part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative (GENEVA), which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). Genotyping was performed at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR). The study was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR).

These data were derived from the Brachymorph source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) The brachymorph mouse and the developmental-genetic basis for canalization and morphological integration:**\n\nAlthough it is well known that many mutations influence phenotypic variability as well as the mean, the underlying mechanisms for variability effects are very poorly understood. The brachymorph (bm) phenotype results from an autosomal recessive mutation in the phosphoadenosine-phosphosulfate synthetase 2 gene [(Papss2)](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:1330223). A major cranial manifestation is a dramatic reduction in the growth of the chondrocranium which results from undersulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the cartilage matrix. Hallgrimsson et al. (2006) found that this reduction in the growth of the chondrocranium is associated with an altered pattern of craniofacial shape variation, a significant increase in phenotypic variance and a dramatic increase in morphological integration for craniofacial shape. Both effects are largest in the basicranium. The altered variation pattern indicates that the mutation produces developmental influences on shape that are not present in the wildtype. As the mutation dramatically reduces sulfation of GAGs, the authors infer that this influence is variation among individuals in the degree of sulfation, or variable expressivity of the mutation. This variation may be because of genetic variation at other loci that influence sulfation, environmental effects, or intrinsic effects. Hallgrimsson and colleagues infer that chondrocranial development exhibits greater sensitivity to variation in the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate when the degree of sulfation is low. At normal levels, sulfation probably contributes minimally to phenotypic variation. This case illustrates canalization in a particular developmental-genetic context.\n\n**(2) Spatial packing, cranial base angulation, and craniofacial shape variation in the mammalian skull:**\n\nThe hypothesis that variation in craniofacial shape within and among species is influenced by spatial packing has a long history in comparative anatomy, particularly in terms of primates. This study develops and tests three alternative models of spatial packing to address how and to what extent the cranial base angle is influenced by variation in brain and facial size. The models are tested using mouse strains with different mutations affecting craniofacial growth. Although mice have distinctive crania with small brains, long faces, and retroflexed cranial bases, the results of the study indicate that the mouse cranial base flexes to accommodate larger brain size relative to cranial base length. In addition, the mouse cranial base also extends, but to a lesser degree, to accommodate larger face size relative to cranial base length. In addition, interactions between brain size, face size, and the widths and lengths of the components of the cranial base account for a large percentage of variation in cranial base angle. The results illustrate the degree to which the cranial base is centrally embedded within the covariation structure of the craniofacial complex as a whole.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nMice homozygous for the brachymorph mutation on a C57BL/6J background and the C57BL/6J wildtype controls were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).

Samples of bm/bm mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation in accordance with the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee and Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.

 {"id":14468,"accession":"FB00001218","title":"Enhancer: A standardized mouse morphology dataset for MusMorph","project":343,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"_This dataset contains processed micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available), all of which were generated for MusMorph. These data were derived from the Enhancer source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Fine tuning of craniofacial morphology by distant-acting enhancers:**\n\nThe shape of the human face and skull is largely genetically determined, but the genetic drivers of craniofacial morphology remain poorly understood. Here, Attanasio et al. (2013) used a combination of epigenomic profiling, in vivo characterization of candidate enhancer sequences in transgenic mice, and targeted deletion experiments to examine the role of distant-acting enhancers in craniofacial development. The authors identified complex regulatory landscapes, consisting of enhancers that drive a remarkable spatial complexity of developmental expression patterns. Deletion of individual craniofacial enhancers from the mouse genome resulted in significant alterations of craniofacial shape, demonstrating their functional importance in defining face and skull morphology. These results demonstrate that enhancers play a pervasive role in mammalian craniofacial development and suggest that enhancer sequence variation contributes to human facial morphology.\n\n**(2) HDAC9 structural variants disrupting TWIST1 transcriptional regulation lead to craniofacial and limb malformations:**\n\nStructural variants (SVs) can affect protein-coding sequences as well as gene regulatory elements. However, SVs disrupting protein-coding sequences that also function as cis-regulatory elements remain largely uncharacterized. Here, Hirsch et al. (2021) show that craniosynostosis patients with SVs containing the Histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) protein-coding sequence are associated with disruption of [TWIST1](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:98872) regulatory elements that reside within [HDAC9](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:1931221) sequence. Based on SVs within the HDAC9-TWIST1 locus, we defined the 3’ HDAC9 sequence (~500Kb) as a critical TWIST1 regulatory region, encompassing craniofacial TWIST1 enhancers and [CTCF](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:109447) sites. Deletions of either Twist1 enhancers (eTw5-7Δ/Δ) or Ctcf site (CtcfΔ/Δ) within the Hdac9 protein-coding sequence in mice led to decreased Twist1 expression and altered anterior\\posterior limb expression patterns of Shh pathway genes. This decreased Twist1 expression results in a smaller sized and asymmetric skull and polydactyly that resembles Twist1+/- mouse phenotype. Chromatin conformation analysis revealed that the Twist1 promoter region interacts with Hdac9 sequences that encompass Twist1 enhancers and a Ctcf site and that interactions depended on the presence of both regulatory regions. Finally, a large inversion of the entire Hdac9 sequence (Hdac9INV/+) in mice that does not disrupt Hdac9 expression but repositions Twist1 regulatory elements showed decreased Twist1 expression and led to a craniosynostosis-like phenotype and polydactyly. Thus, this study elucidated essential components of TWIST1 transcriptional machinery that reside within the HDAC9 sequence, suggesting that SVs, encompassing protein-coding sequence, such as HDAC9, could lead to a phenotype that is not attributed to its protein function but rather to a disruption of the transcriptional regulation of a nearby gene, such as TWIST1.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and line generation:**\n\nAttanasio et al. deleted three selected craniofacial enhancers from the mouse genome using previously described standard methods (Ahituv et al. 2007). The three enhancers, termed hs1431 (near Snai2), hs746 (near Msx1) and hs586 (near Isl1), were chosen based on their association with known craniofacial genesDeletion size for each enhancer is 3828bp (hs1431), 1682bp (hs746) and 1098bp (hs586). Briefly, targeted enhancers were independently deleted in W4/129S6 mouse embryonic stem cells (Taconic, http://www.taconic.com/) by homologous recombination with a LoxP-flanked neomycin cassette, followed by the excision of the neomycin cassette by Cre-mediated recombination of LoxP sites. Positive colonies in each stage were confirmed by PCR (data not shown) and Southern analysis and injected into C57BL/6J blastocyst stage embryos. Chimeric mice were crossed to C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, http://www.criver.com) to generate heterozygous craniofacial enhancer deletion mice. Heterozygous mice were bred to produce enhancer null mice. All expected genotypes (wild-type, heterozygotes and homozygotes) were observed at expected rations.\n\nHirsch et al. created two mouse strains, eTw5-7 ∆/∆ and Hdac9 Inv/+ , using a modified CRISPR/Cas9 protocol30. In addition, the authors exploited a mouse model where exons 6 and 7 of the Hdac9 sequence, along with a Ctcf site at the interionic sequence were deleted21. Briefly, for eTw5-7 ∆/∆, two sgRNAs targeting a 23 kb sequence that encompasses the three enhancers and exons 17–20 of Hdac9 (23,137bp; chr12:34883772–34906909; mm9) were designed using CHOPCHOP31. Similarly, for Hdac9 inversion two gRNAs were designed, targeting regions delimitating the whole Hdac9 gene (chr12:34721220-35613000, 891,781 bp). No potential off-targets were found when searching for matches in the mouse genome (mm9) when allowing for up to two mismatches in the 20 nucleotide-long sequence preceding the PAM sequence. The T7 promoter was added to the sgRNA template, and the whole cassette was chemically synthesized by IDT. The PCR amplified T7-sgRNA product was used as a template for in vitro transcription using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cas9 mRNA was transcribed in vitro using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The DNA template for in vitro transcription containing the humanized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 gene was PCRamplified from the px330 plasmid. eTw5-7 ∆/∆ and Hdac9INV/+ mice were generated by injecting a mix of Cas9 mRNA (final concentration of 100 ng/ul) and sgRNA (50 ng/ul) in injection buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 0.1 mM EDTA) into the cytoplasm of C57black embryos in accordance with the standard procedure approved by Ben-Gurion University. Female mice of the ICR (CD-1) strain were used as foster mothers. F0 mice were genotyped using PCR to detect the deletion of enhancers from the mouse genome\n\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA). To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"PN56 Snai2 PN84 Ctcf PN79 PN102 Msx1 Snai2-/- PN58 hs1629+/+ Hdac9Inv/+ PN78 PN82 tomography Sox5NA 3-KB02 PN97 Hallgrimsson musculus gene. altered PN90 Sox5 PN74 head C57BL/6J female micro-computed Isl1+/+ product PN108 PN77 molecular PN72 male Isl1-/- function PN60 PN87 Twist1+/- PN94 Snai2+/+ Benedikt analysis Mus PN71 PN70 (microCT) PN69 PN66 PN80 PN103 PN99 Morphometric FACEBASE:3-VP6A gene PN95 null organism A Hdac9 https://www.facebase.org/id/3-VP6A Sox5-/- PN73 Craniosynostosis type PN76 Twist1-/- Isl1 lacks PN61 mutation hs1629-/- PN92 PN57 PN75 PN67 Msx1-/- C57BL/6J;129 Sox5+/+ wild-type Ctcf-/- Twist1 PN55 Msx1+/+","RID":"3-KB02","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b4c06232-fced-4530-ba5e-a8fe378ac2a6","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2021-09-27T17:27:26.378819+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/3-KB02","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

Tooth root shapes are finely tuned to provide precise occlusal support to facilitate the function of each tooth type. However, the mechanism regulating tooth root patterning and development is largely unknown. In this study, we provide the first in vivo evidence demonstrating that Ezh2 in the dental mesenchyme determines patterning and furcation formation during dental root development in mouse molars. Mechanistically, an antagonistic interaction between epigenetic regulators Ezh2 and Arid1a controls Cdkn2a expression in the dental mesenchyme to regulate dental root patterning and development. These findings indicate the importance of balanced epigenetic regulation in determining the tooth root pattern and the integration of roots with the jawbones to achieve physiological function. Collectively, our study provides important clues about the regulation of organogenesis and has general implications for tooth regeneration in the future.\n\nThe data files corresponding to this dataset can be obtained from GEO following the link given in the Related Datasets section below.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"Molar samples from PN3 days Ezh2fl/fl (control) and Osr2-Cre;Ezh2fl/fl mice (n = 4 per group) were collected for RNA isolation with RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN).

 {"id":14466,"accession":"FB00001216","title":"Spry: A standardized mouse morphology dataset for MusMorph","project":343,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"_This dataset contains processed micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available), all of which were generated for MusMorph. These data were derived from the Spry source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) The interaction of genetic background and mutational effects in regulation of mouse craniofacial shape:**\n\nInbred genetic background significantly influences the expression of phenotypes associated with known genetic perturbations and can underlie variation in disease severity between individuals with the same mutation. However, the effect of epistatic interactions on the development of complex traits, such as craniofacial morphology, is poorly understood. Here, Percival et al. (2017) investigated the effect of three inbred backgrounds (129X1/SvJ, C57BL/6J, and FVB/NJ) on the expression of craniofacial dysmorphology in mice with loss of function in three members of the Sprouty family of growth factor negative regulators ([Spry1](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:1345139), [Spry2](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:1345138), or [Spry4](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:1345144)) in order to explore the impact of epistatic interactions on skull morphology. The authors found that the interaction of inbred background and the Sprouty genotype explains as much craniofacial shape variation as the Sprouty genotype alone. The most severely affected genotypes display a relatively short and wide skull, a rounded cranial vault, and a more highly angled inferior profile. Their results suggest that the FVB background is more resilient to Sprouty loss of function than either C57 or 129, and that Spry4 loss is generally less severe than loss of Spry1 or Spry2. While the specific modifier genes responsible for these significant background effects remain unknown, their results highlight the value of intercrossing mice of multiple inbred backgrounds to identify the genes and developmental interactions that modulate the severity of craniofacial dysmorphology. These quantitative results represent an important first step toward elucidating genetic interactions underlying variation in robustness to known genetic perturbations in mice.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nAll mice (Mus musculus) were bred at the University of California, San Francisco in compliance with relevant animal care guidelines and experimentation protocols. Mouse lines carrying null alleles of Spry1 (Basson et al. 2005), Spry2 (Shim et al. 2005), and Spry4 (Klein et al. 2006) were acquired as knockout mice (gift from G. Martin) and maintained on a Crl:CD1(ICR) mixed background within the Klein lab. These three strains were then independently backcrossed, using the standard procedure for producing congenic lines, onto the 129X1/SvJ, C57BL/6J, and FVB/NJ backgrounds for between 6 and 27 generations. The Sprouty genotype of each backcrossed specimen was assessed by PCR. Heterozygotes of these backcrossed null mice were crossed to produce litters that included homozygote null (−/−), heterozygote null (+/−), and homozygote controls (+/+) of each knockout by background pair. Therefore, the sample includes representatives from 18 genotype-by-background combinations. While some of our sample were not strictly isogenic in their genetic background (<20 generations of backcrossing), congenic backcrossing for six generations results in >95% homozygosity across the genome (Silver 1995). All specimens were killed at ∼8 wk of age.\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA). To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"PN56 Spry2 Mus Spry4+/+ analysis Benedikt Spry2+/- (microCT) 3-JZAM Spry1 tomography Spry4-/- Spry1+/- Morphometric Spry4 Hallgrimsson FACEBASE:3-VP6A gene musculus gene. altered null Spry2+/+ organism A Spry1-/- https://www.facebase.org/id/3-VP6A type head lacks mutation micro-computed female Spry1+/+ product wild-type Spry2-/- male molecular function Spry4+/-","RID":"3-JZAM","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b4c06232-fced-4530-ba5e-a8fe378ac2a6","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2021-09-24T23:02:08.234443+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/3-JZAM","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

In the US, the prevalence in adults is approximately 90% (Beltran-Aguilar et al., 2005), and in some high-risk populations, the prevalence is even higher. Treatment of dental caries consumes significant resources each year, and untreated caries lesions can lead to pain, tooth loss, and oral infection, or other co-morbidities. Cariogenesis is affected my numerous environmental, behavioral, and genetic factors, including dietary behaviors, bacterial flora, fluoride exposure, salivary factors, tooth morphology, etc. (Hunter, 1988; Anderson, 2002). This study includes analyses stratified by fluoride exposure, to address the role of genes and gene-by-fluoride interactions in the etiology of this disease.\n\nClick [here](/hgai/DENT1.html) to access the data and results for this dataset.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"Participants were drawn from three studies: the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia (COHRA) [Polk et al., 2008], the Iowa Fluoride Study (IFS) [Levy et al., 2003], and the Iowa Head Start Study (IHS).\n\nPrimary dentition affection status (i.e., yes/no for dft score ≥ 1) was assessed by intra-oral examination and included white-spot lesions, which are the earliest clinically detectable caries lesions. Fluoride levels were obtained from samples of non-municipal and filtered home water sources or from the Iowa Department of Public Health (for unfiltered municipal water). For purposes of stratification, fluoride exposure was dichotomized as low (< 0.7 mg/L) or sufficient (≥ 0.7 mg/L).

These data were derived from the Pten source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Inactivation of Pten in osteo-chondroprogenitor cells leads to epiphyseal growth plate abnormalities and skeletal overgrowth:**\n\nTo study the role of the [Pten](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:109583) tumor suppressor in skeletogenesis, Ford-Hutchinson et al. (2007) generated mice lacking this key phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathway regulator in their osteo-chondroprogenitors. A phenotype of growth plate dysfunction and skeletal overgrowth was observed.\n\n**(2) Mind the gap -- genetic manipulation of basicranial growth within synchondroses modulates calvarial and facial shape in mice through epigenetic interactions:**\n\nPhenotypic integration patterns in the mammalian skull have long been a focus of intense interest as a result of their suspected influence on the trajectory of hominid evolution. Here, Parsons et al. (2015) test the hypothesis that perturbation of cartilage growth, which directly affects only the chondrocranium during development, will produce coordinated shape changes in the adult calvarium and face regardless of mechanism. Using two murine models of cartilage undergrowth that target two very different mechanisms, the authors show that strong reduction in cartilage growth produces a short, wide, and more flexed cranial base. This in turn produces a short, wide face in both models. Cranial base and face are already correlated early in ontogeny, and the relationship between these modules gains structure through postnatal growth and development. These results provide further evidence that there exist physical interactions between developing parts of the phenotype that produce variation at a distance from the actual locus upon which a particular selective pressure is acting. Phenotypic changes observed over the course of evolution may not all require adaptationist explanations; rather, it is likely that a substantial portion of observed phenotypic variation over the history of a clade is not directly adaptive but rather a secondary consequence of some local response to selection.\n\n**(3) Mouse models and the evolutionary developmental biology of the skull:**\n\nUnderstanding development is relevant to understanding evolution because developmental processes structure the expression of phenotypic variation upon which natural selection acts. Advances in developmental biology are fueling a new synthesis of developmental and evolutionary biology, but it remains unclear how to use developmental information that largely derives from a few model organisms to test hypotheses about the evolutionary developmental biology of taxa such as humans and other primates that have not been or are not amenable to direct study through experimental developmental biology. In this article, Hallgrimsson et al. (2008) discuss how and when model organisms like mice are useful for studying the evolutionary developmental biology of even rather distantly related and morphologically different groups like primates. A productive approach is to focus on processes that are likely to play key roles in producing evolutionarily significant phenotypic variation across a large phylogenetic range. The authors illustrate this approach by applying the analysis of craniofacial variation in mouse mutant models to primate and human evolution.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nMice were maintained in a viral antibody-free barrier facility in accordance with University of Calgary and Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines and killed by CO2 inhalation. Ptenfl/fl mice, on a mixed C57BL/6 × 129 genetic background, were generously provided by Dr TW Mak (Ontario Cancer Institute). After three backcrosses to C57BL/6J, these mice were mated with the mixed background (SJL/J × C57BL6J) Col2a1Cre transgenic line (Jackson Laboratory) to generate mice hemizygous for both the floxed Pten and the Col2a1Cre transgene loci: these animals (of mixed genetic background) were interbred to yield not only the experimental group, Ptenfl/fl: Col2a1Cre, but also the littermate controls that were used for all the experiments, consisting of either Ptenfl/fl and Ptenfl/wt mice.\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA).

The etiology of orofacial clefting is multifactorial, including genetic or environmental factors or their combination. A large body of work has focused on the molecular etiology of cleft lip and clefts of the hard palate, but study of the underlying etiology of soft palate clefts is an emerging field. Recent advances in the understanding of soft palate development suggest that it may be regulated by distinct pathways from those implicated in hard palate development. Soft palate clefting leads to muscle misorientation and oropharyngeal deficiency and adversely affects speech, swallowing, breathing, and hearing. Hence, there is an important need to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of soft palate development. Significantly, the anatomy, function, and development of soft palatal muscles are similar in humans and mice, rendering the mouse an excellent model for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms of soft palate clefts. \n\n","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":null,"release_date":"2020-09-28","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"Mus 1-778P palate E15.5 Yang type assay Keyence BZ-X710 Type E13.5 Wild microscopy E14.5 Chai Palate musculus secondary","RID":"1-778P","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/93416595-2bc4-42a8-b5b9-9b7c6fdc1d89","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2020-02-03T18:28:02.749489+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/1-778P","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

These data were derived from the Fgf source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Developmental nonlinearity drives phenotypic robustness:**\n\nRobustness to perturbation is a fundamental feature of complex organisms. Mutations are the raw material for evolution, yet robustness to their effects is required for species survival. The mechanisms that produce robustness are poorly understood. Nonlinearities are a ubiquitous feature of development that may link variation in development to phenotypic robustness. Here, Green et al. (2017) manipulate the gene dosage of a signaling molecule, [Fgf8](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:99604), a critical regulator of vertebrate development. They demonstrate that variation in Fgf8 expression has a nonlinear relationship to phenotypic variation, predicting levels of robustness among genotypes. Differences in robustness are not due to gene expression variance or dysregulation, but emerge from the nonlinearity of the genotype–phenotype curve. In this instance, embedded features of development explain robustness differences. How such features vary in natural populations and relate to genetic variation are key questions for unraveling the origin and evolvability of this feature of organismal development.\n\nThe Fgf dataset is related to the Ap2, BBDS, and Bulgy datasets.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nThe Fgf8neo series is a five-member series generated from a combination of the neomycin insertion into the intron between exons 2 and 3 of the Fgf8 locus and a null allele generated from loss of exon 2. The Fgf8;Crect series contains combinations of a floxed allele for Fgf8, a null allele for Fgf8, and then Fgf8 is deleted from the ectoderm around E9.5 using an ectodermal Cre (CRECT) (Fig. 2). The two series of mice were generated independently by different labs (Crect, T. Williams) (Neo, R. Marcucio/J. Fish). Both series of Fgf8 mice were generated from the Fgf8 flp/floxed allele originally developed by Meyers et al.46. The neo cassette was maintained in the Fgf8Neo mice. To generate the floxed allele for the CRECT studies, the neomycin resistance cassette was removed by crossing these mice to β-actin-flp (B6.CgTg (ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J), generating the floxed allele. Deletion constructs were developed by crossing with β-actin Cre (FVB/N-Tg(ACTB-cre)2Mrt/J), to delete exons 2 and 3 from all cells. To generate the Fgf8neo series, crosses were performed between mice that were heterozygous for the Neo (flp) allele or heterozygous for the Neo (flp) allele and the null allele.\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nFor embryos, pregnant dams were sacrificed at embryonic day (E) 10.5 based on visualization of a postcoital plug at E0.5. Embryos were dissected on ice and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% glutaraldehyde prior to micro-CT scanning. All samples were micro-CT scanned on a μCT35 scanner (Scanco) to visualize facial shape. Prior to scanning, embryos were submersed in CystoCon Ray II (iothalamate meglumine) contrast agent for 1 h, and then scanned at 7.5-μm resolution. Adult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA).

Tooth development is a well established model for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate organogenesis. Despite advances in our understanding of how tooth crown formation is regulated, we have limited understanding of tooth root development. RUNX2 is a well-known transcription factor in osteogenic differentiation and early tooth development. However, the function of RUNX2 during tooth root formation remains unknown. We revealed in this study that RUNX2 is expressed in a subpopulation of GLI1+ root progenitor cells, and that loss of Runx2 in these GLI1+ progenitor cells and their progeny results in root developmental defects. Our results provide in vivo evidence that Runx2 plays a crucial role in tooth root development and in regulating the differentiation of root progenitor cells. Furthermore, we identified that Gli1, Pcp4, Notum, and Sfrp2 are downstream targets of Runx2 by integrating bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Specifically, ablation of Runx2 results in downregulation of WNT inhibitor Notum and upregulation of canonical WNT signaling in the odontoblastic site, which disturbs normal odontoblastic differentiation. Significantly, exogenous NOTUM partially rescues the impaired root development in Runx2 mutant molars. Collectively, our studies elucidate how Runx2 achieves functional specificity in regulating the development of diverse organs and yields new insights into the network that regulates tooth root development.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**RNAseq**\nGli1-CreERT2;Runx2fl/fl and Runx2fl/fl littermate control mice received 1 injection of tamoxifen at PN3.5 and were euthanized 4 days later.

Each sample contained tissue from 4 mice. cDNA library preparation and sequencing were carried out by the Technology Center for Genomics & Bioinformatics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). A total of 200 million pair6 end reads were obtained on NovaSeq 6000 S2 for 4 pairs of samples. The raw data was analyzed using Partek® Flow® software. Briefly, raw reads were trimmed, aligned by STAR (2.6.1d) with the mm10 genome, and normalized using FPKM. Differential analysis was performed using the gene set analysis (GSA) method.

Then the molars were cut into small pieces and transferred into digestion solution (2 mg/ml Collagenase I + 2 mg/ml Dispase, dissolved in HBSS). Samples were incubated at 37℃ with rotation in a Hybaid Oven for 25 minutes, with occasional pipetting. Then the samples were passed through a Flowmi cell strainer (Scienceware, porosity 40 μm) to obtain a single-cell suspension. The Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3 was used for GEM generation and library construction, according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. The cDNA sequencing was conducted by the Technology Center for Genomics & Bioinformatics at UCLA. Quality control, mapping, and count table assembly of the library were performed using the CellRanger pipeline version 3.1.0.\nRaw read counts from the control and Gli1-CreERT2;Runx2fl/fl sample were analyzed using the Seurat v3 R package. Data were first filtered and normalized, then the FindVariableGenes function was used to select variable genes. The FindIntegrationAnchors function was used to identify “anchors” across the two datasets, which were then used to integrate the two datasets with the IntegrateData function.

 {"id":14343,"accession":"FB00001097","title":"MicroRNA-124-3p suppresses mouse lip mesenchymal cell proliferation through the regulation of genes associated with cleft lip in the mouse.","project":328,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"**BACKGROUND:**\nCleft lip (CL), one of the most common congenital birth defects, shows considerable geographic and ethnic variation, with contribution of both genetic and environmental factors. Mouse genetic studies have identified several CL-associated genes. However, it remains elusive how these CL-associated genes are regulated and involved in CL. Environmental factors may regulate these genes at the post-transcriptional level through the regulation of non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we sought to identify miRNAs associated with CL in mice.\n\n**RESULTS:**\nThrough a systematic literature review and a Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database search, we identified 55 genes that were associated with CL in mice. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis of these genes predicted that a total of 33 miRNAs target multiple CL-associated genes, with 20 CL-associated genes being potentially regulated by multiple miRNAs. To experimentally validate miRNA function in cell proliferation, we conducted cell proliferation/viability assays for the selected five candidate miRNAs (miR-124-3p, let-7a-5p, let-7b-5p, let-7c-5p, and let-7d-5p). Overexpression of miR-124-3p, but not of the others, inhibited cell proliferation through suppression of CL-associated genes in cultured mouse embryonic lip mesenchymal cells (MELM cells) isolated from the developing mouse lip region. By contrast, miR-124-3p knockdown had no effect on MELM cell proliferation. This miRNA-gene regulatory mechanism was mostly conserved in O9-1 cells, an established cranial neural crest cell line. Expression of miR-124-3p was low in the maxillary processes at E10.5, when lip mesenchymal cells proliferate, whereas it was greatly increased at later developmental stages, suggesting that miR-124-3p expression is suppressed during the proliferation phase in normal palate development.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS:**\nOur findings indicate that upregulated miR-124-3p inhibits cell proliferation in cultured lip cells through suppression of CL-associated genes. These results will have a significant impact, not only on our knowledge about lip morphogenesis, but also on the development of clinical approaches for the diagnosis and prevention of CL.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Information sources for the gene search**\nWe followed a guideline set forth by PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) [Moher et al., 2009. PMID:19621072]  for the systematic CL gene search. Public online databases Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and PubMed (NLM) were searched for articles and information on mouse CL-associated genes. In order to recover any missing data related to CL, we searched Scopus (Elsevier) and the MGI database. RefWorks was used for sorting the references and excluding duplicates from the systematic review, as described previously [Sangani et al., 2015. PMID: 27695703].\n\n**Eligibility criteria for the systematic review**\nThe following inclusion criteria were applied in the selection of the articles:\n\n    1. genetic studies for mouse CL;\n\n    2. original articles (no review articles, editorials, or comments);\n\n    3. published in English;\n\n    4. articles specifying the genes responsible for CL in mice.\n\nAfter the step above, we manually excluded those studies meeting one or more of the following criteria:\n\n    1. conducted primarily in other species;\n\n    2. describing environmental factors for CL instead of genetic factors.\n\n**Search strategy to identify the studies**\nA systematic literature search was conducted independently by two screeners using the Medline (Ovid), PubMed (NLM), and Embase (Ovid) databases. To conduct the search, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were developed, as described previously [Suzuki et al., 2019. PMID: 29475039]. Different combinations and variations of the term ‘CL’ (i.e. CL, CL/P, CL and palate) were searched along with other terms such as ‘mice’ (or ‘mouse’), ‘genetics’, and ‘mutation’. Additionally, the bibliographies of the relevant articles were manually examined in Scopus (Elsevier) to retrieve studies that were not identified in the database searches.\n\n**Study design and case selection**\nRefWorks (ProQuest) and systematic review Excel workbooks were used to store and track all citations found in the search process and to eliminate duplicates. The Kappa statistic was used to determine the level of agreement between the two screeners. Full-text articles for which there was a disagreement were re-evaluated based on the inclusion criteria. A codebook for data extraction from the articles meeting the eligibility criteria was developed as previously described [Sangani et al., 2015. PMID: 27695703].\n\n**Bioinformatic analysis**\nThe miRNA-target gene relationships were collected from four resources, including miRTarbase, a database of experimentally validated miRNA-gene interactions [Chou et al., 2016. PMID: 26590260], and three databases for predicted miRNA-gene interactions (miRanda [John et al., 2004. PMID: 15502875], PITA [Kertesz et al., 2007. PMID: 17893677] and TargetScan [Lewis et al., 2005. PMID: 15652477]). The Fisher’s exact test was used to test the significance level of the shared genes between miRNA target genes and mouse CL-associated genes. The Benjamini–Hochberg method was used for multiple test correction [Benjamini and Hochberg., 2005].\n\n**Reference databases**\n- [https://www.ovid.com/platforms/point-of-reference/databases.html](https://www.ovid.com/platforms/point-of-reference/databases.html)\n- [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)\n- [http://www.informatics.jax.org/](http://www.informatics.jax.org/)","release_date":"2020-07-07","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"data Mus E11.5 analysis E12.5 mirlet7c-5 mirlet7a-5 Iwata lip mirlet7d-5 MIR124-3 E13.5 Junichi mirlet7b-5 musculus secondary 1-HW9A E10.5","RID":"1-HW9A","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/bdbab89d-1104-40b1-9f2f-33eeef1a3a6d","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2020-05-09T21:25:40.258258+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/1-HW9A","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

In this study, we investigated the contribution of microRNAs (miRNAs) to cell proliferation and regulation of genes involved in CP development.\n\n**METHODS:**\nIn order to identify all genes for which mutations or association/linkage have been found in individuals with CP, we conducted a systematic literature search, followed by bioinformatics analyses for these genes. We validated the bioinformatics results experimentally by conducting cell proliferation assays and miRNA-gene regulatory analyses in cultured human palatal mesenchymal cells treated with each miRNA mimic.\n\n**RESULTS:**\nWe identified 131 CP-associated genes in the systematic review. The bioinformatics analysis indicated that the CP genes were associated with signaling pathways, microRNAs (miRNAs), metabolic pathways, and cell proliferation. A total 17 miRNAs were recognized as potential modifiers of human CP genes. To validate miRNA function in cell proliferation, a main cause of CP, we conducted cell proliferation/viability assays for the top 11 candidate miRNAs from our bioinformatics analysis. Overexpression of miR-133b, miR-374a-5p, and miR-4680-3p resulted in a more than 30% reduction in cell proliferation activity in human palatal mesenchymal cell cultures. We found that several downstream target CP genes predicted by the bioinformatics analyses were significantly downregulated through induction of these miRNAs (FGFR1, GCH1, PAX7, SMC2, and SUMO1 by miR-133b; ARNT, BMP2, CRISPLD1, FGFR2, JARID2, MSX1, NOG, RHPN2, RUNX2, WNT5A and ZNF236 by miR-374a-5p; and ERBB2, JADE1, MTHFD1 and WNT5A by miR-4680-3p) in cultured cells.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS:**\nOur results indicate that miR-374a-5p, miR-4680-3p, and miR-133b regulate expression of genes that are involved in the etiology of human CP, providing insight into the association between CP-associated genes and potential targets of miRNAs in palate development.\n\n**REFERENCE DATABASES:**\n- [http://geneontology.org](http://geneontology.org)\n- [https://www.genome.jp/kegg](https://www.genome.jp/kegg)","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Eligibility criteria for the systematic review**\nThis systematic review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline and corresponding checklist.

The exclusion criteria were the following: 1) gene mutations were not described; 2) CP was not involved; 3) CP was caused by environmental factors.\n\n**Information sources and search**\nThe Medline (Ovid), PubMed (National Library of Medicine), and EMBASE (Ovid) databases were used for the online searches. Any exceptional studies missed by the database searches were retrieved by a Scopus (Elsevier) search.

In animals and fungi, orthologs of NIPBL regulate cohesin, a complex of proteins that is essential for chromosome cohesion and is also implicated in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. Mice heterozygous for a gene-trap mutation in Nipbl were produced and exhibited defects characteristic of CdLS, including small size, craniofacial anomalies, microbrachycephaly, heart defects, hearing abnormalities, delayed bone maturation, reduced body fat, behavioral disturbances, and high mortality (75–80%) during the first weeks of life. These phenotypes arose despite a decrease in Nipbl transcript levels of only ∼30%, implying extreme sensitivity of development to small changes in Nipbl activity. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that Nipbl deficiency leads to modest but significant transcriptional dysregulation of many genes. Expression changes at the protocadherin beta (Pcdhb) locus, as well as at other loci, support the view that NIPBL influences long-range chromosomal regulatory interactions. In addition, evidence is presented that reduced expression of genes involved in adipogenic differentiation may underlie the low amounts of body fat observed both in Nipbl+/− mice and in individuals with CdLS.\n\n**(2) Conditional creation and rescue of Nipbl-deficiency in mice reveals multiple determinants of risk for congenital heart defects:**\n\nElucidating the causes of congenital heart defects is made difficult by the complex morphogenesis of the mammalian heart, which takes place early in development, involves contributions from multiple germ layers, and is controlled by many genes. Here, Santos et al. (2016) use a conditional/invertible genetic strategy to identify the cell lineage(s) responsible for the development of heart defects in a Nipbl-deficient mouse model of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome, in which global yet subtle transcriptional dysregulation leads to development of atrial septal defects (ASDs) at high frequency. Using an approach that allows for recombinase-mediated creation or rescue of Nipbl deficiency in different lineages, the authors uncover complex interactions between the cardiac mesoderm, endoderm, and the rest of the embryo, whereby the risk conferred by genetic abnormality in any one lineage is modified, in a surprisingly non-additive way, by the status of others. Santos and colleagues argue that these results are best understood in the context of a model in which the risk of heart defects is associated with the adequacy of early progenitor cell populations relative to the sizes of the structures they must eventually form.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nA search for Nipbl sequences in mouse gene-trap databases (http://www.genetrap.org/) initially identified two targeted ES cell lines (generated using the E14 parental cell line, which has a 129/Ola background). One of these (RRS564) contains a gene-trap in the intron between exon1 and exon 2; the other (RRJ102) in intron 25 (the exon numbering of [16] for the human gene is used here). Gene-trap constructs are designed to terminate transcription and translation, producing a truncated or absent protein product. Both cell lines were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice (for the RRJ102 cell line, 83 blastocysts were injected; for RRS564, 324 blastocysts were injected). Multiple male chimeras were obtained and bred against outbred (CD-1; Charles River) females. Germ line progeny (distinguishable by chinchilla coat color) were obtained only from RRS564-derived chimeras, and further work on RRJ102 was suspended. The RRS564 allele is hereafter referred to as Nipbl564 and mice heterozygous for this allele as Nipbl+/− for simplicity. Nipbl+/− mice were maintained under normal laboratory conditions, and the line propagated by successive rounds of outcrossing to CD-1 mice.

These data were derived from the Wnt source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Phenotypic variability and craniofacial dysmorphology -- increased shape variance in a mouse model for cleft lip:**\n\nCleft lip and palate (CL/P), as is true of many craniofacial malformations in humans, is etiologically complex and highly variable in expression. A/WySn mice are an intriguing model for human CL/P because they develop this dysmorphology with a variable expression pattern, incomplete penetrance and frequent unilateral expression on a homogeneous genetic background. The developmental basis for this variation in expression is unknown, but of great significance for understanding such expression patterns in humans. As a step towards this goal, this study used three-dimensional geometric morphometric and novel high throughput morphometric techniques based on three-dimensional computed microtomography of mouse embryos to analyze craniofacial shape variation during primary palate formation. Parsons et al. (2008) analysis confirmed previous findings based on two-dimensional analyses that the midface in A/WySn embryos, and the maxillary prominence in particular, is relatively reduced in size and appears to be developmentally delayed. In addition, the authors find that shape variance is increased in A/WySn embryos during primary palate formation compared to both C57BL/6J mice and the F1 crosses between these strains. If the reduction in midfacial growth caused by the Wnt9b hypomorphic mutation pushes A/WySn mice closer on average to the threshold for cleft lip formation, the elevated shape variance may explain why some, but not all, embryos develop the dysmorphology in a genetically homogeneous inbred line of mice.\n\n**(2) Nonlinear gene expression-phenotype relationships contribute to variation and clefting in the A/WySn mouse:**\n\nCleft lip and palate is one of the most common human birth defects, but the underlying etiology is poorly understood. The A/WySn mouse is a spontaneously occurring model of multigenic clefting in which 20% to 30% of individuals develop an orofacial cleft. Recent work has shown altered methylation at a specific retrotransposon insertion downstream of the [Wnt9b](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:1197020) locus in clefting animals, which results in decreased Wnt9b expression. Using a newly developed protocol that allows us to measure morphology, gene expression, and DNA methylation in the same embryo, Green et al. (2019) relate gene expression in an individual embryo directly to its three-dimensional morphology for the first time. The authors find that methylation at the retrotransposon relates to Wnt9b expression and morphology. IAP methylation relates to shape of the nasal process in a manner consistent with clefting. Embryos with low IAP methylation exhibit increased among-individual variance in facial shape. Methylation and gene expression relate nonlinearly to nasal process morphology. Individuals at one end of a continuum of phenotypic states display a clinical phenotype and increased phenotypic variation. Variable penetrance and expressivity in this model is likely determined both by among-individual variation in methylation and changes in phenotypic robustness along the underlying liability distribution for orofacial clefting.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nA/WySnJ mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbour, Maine).

Matings were set, and each morning thereafter, the dams were checked for the presence of a postcoital plug. Dams were sacrificed by means of isoflurane anesthesia followed by cervical dislocation on day 11 following visualization of the postcoital plug, this being embryonic day (E)11.5.

 {"id":14507,"accession":"FB00001252","title":"Collective migration in secondary palate fusion is controlled by actomyosin contractility","project":351,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"To determine how loss of NMII activity affected epithelial cell behaviors underlying secondary palate fusion, we performed live imaging of _Myh9lox/lox; CrectTg/0; R26mTmG/+_ embryos and compared them with controls with preserved NMII function. Whereas controls exhibited streaming collective epithelial migration, complete loss of NMIIA in _Myh9lox/lox; CrectTg/0; R26mTmG/+_ mutants resulted in the complete loss of epithelial trail organization, wherein GFP+ MES-lineage cells that traveled in a disorderly fashion, had more protrusive shapes and were ultimately not cleared from the palatal shelf mesenchyme. To better understand how NMII regulates collective epithelial migration, we performed live imaging of control (_Myh9f/+; Myh10f/+; CrectTg/0; R26mTmG/+_) embryos treated with the SiR-Actin spirochrome dye to observe filamentous actin over the course of MES removal. We found that epithelial trails undergoing migration to the nasal and oral epithelium exhibited anisotropic distribution of filamentous actin cables at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface. As epithelial trails underwent collective movement toward the nasal and oral epithelium, these actomyosin cables contracted in a pulsatile fashion and appeared to move epithelial trails in a peristaltic fashion toward the oral and nasal edges, although precise manipulation of localized actomyosin contractility will be required to test this prediction functionally. Thus, these data reveal a unique form of collective epithelial migration that is responsible for MES clearance during secondary palate fusion.\n\nNote: The data files in this dataset are in CZI format which is a Zeiss proprietary imaging format. These 4D CZI files can be converted to an open source format like OME.TIF using the **bfconvert** command line tool from Bio-Formats, publicly available at [openmicroscopy.org](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/)\n","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"The confocal live-imaging approach was adapted from our previous work (Kim et al., 2015, 2017), but applied on fresh secondary palate sagittal thick sections. Embryo heads were dissected and the top of the head, calvaria primordia and lower jaw were removed in ice-cold PBS. The remaining tissue, including the maxillae, was embedded in 5% low-melt agarose. Blocks were sectioned in ice-cold DMEM/F12 media to 250 µm slices using a Leica CT1000S vibratome. Regions of interest were confirmed by visualization of the endogenous EGFP reporter on a spinning disk confocal microscope. Sections were laid flat in a 35 mm No. 1.0 uncoated glass bottom dish (MatTek) and embedded in a mixture of agarose and culture media [20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 200 µg/ml L-ascorbic acid to Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F12 media (Gibco DMEM/F12 without Phenol Red)]. This mixture was made by adding 3.5% low-melting agarose immediately prior to embedding, to a final concentration of 0.6%. For experiments that visualized F-actin, SiR-Actin (Spirochrome, CY SC001, 1:5000) was added to culture media immediately prior to the addition of agarose. Sagittal live imaging of the MES was performed using a Zeiss Cell Observer spinning disk confocal microscope or a Zeiss LSM900 laser scanning confocal equipped with a 37°C incubation chamber. Time-lapse images were captured with 488 nm and 647 nm (for SiR-Actin only) laser excitation for approximately 24 h at 15-min intervals.

 {"id":14478,"accession":"FB00001227","title":"Bmp: A standardized mouse morphology dataset for MusMorph","project":343,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"_This dataset contains processed micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available), all of which were generated for MusMorph. These data were derived from the Bmp source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Bone morphogenetic protein 2 coordinates early tooth mineralization:**\n\nFormation of highly organized dental hard tissues is a complex process involving sequential and ordered deposition of an extracellular scaffold, followed by its mineralization. Odontoblast and ameloblast differentiation involves reciprocal and sequential epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Similar to early tooth development, various Bmps are expressed during this process, although their functions have not been explored in detail. Here, Malik et al. (2018) investigated the role of odontoblast-derived [Bmp2](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:88177) for tooth mineralization using Bmp2 conditional knockout mice. In developing molars, Bmp2LacZ reporter mice revealed restricted expression of Bmp2 in early polarized and functional odontoblasts while it was not expressed in mature odontoblasts. Loss of Bmp2 in neural crest cells, which includes all dental mesenchyme, caused a delay in dentin and enamel deposition. This study establishes that Bmp2 provides an early temporal, nonredundant signal for directed and organized tooth mineralization.\n\n**(2) Impact of retinoic acid exposure on midfacial shape variation and manifestation of holoprosencephaly in Twsg1 mutant mice:**\n\nHoloprosencephaly (HPE) is a developmental anomaly characterized by inadequate or absent midline division of the embryonic forebrain and midline facial defects. It is believed that interactions between genes and the environment play a role in the widely variable penetrance and expressivity of HPE, although direct investigation of such effects has been limited. The goal of this study was to examine whether mice carrying a mutation in a gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist twisted gastrulation [(Twsg1)](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:2137520), which is associated with a low penetrance of HPE, are sensitized to retinoic acid (RA) teratogenesis. Although only 7% of wild-type embryos exposed to RA showed overt HPE or neural tube defects (NTDs), 100% of Twsg1−/− mutants exposed to RA manifested severe HPE compared to 17% without RA. Remarkably, up to 30% of Twsg1+/− mutants also showed HPE (23%) or NTDs (7%). The majority of shape variation among Twsg1+/− mutants was associated with narrowing of the midface. In P19 cells, RA induced the expression of Bmp2, acted in concert with BMP2 to increase p53 expression, caspase activation and oxidative stress. This study provides direct evidence for modifying effects of the environment in a genetic mouse model carrying a predisposing mutation for HPE in the Twsg1 gene.\n\n**(3) Common mechanisms in development and disease -- BMP signaling in craniofacial development:**\n\nBMP signaling is one of the key pathways regulating craniofacial development. It is involved in the early patterning of the head, the development of cranial neural crest cells, and facial patterning. It regulates development of its mineralized structures, such as cranial bones, maxilla, mandible, palate, and teeth. Targeted mutations in the mouse have been instrumental to delineate the functional involvement of this signaling network in different aspects of craniofacial development. Gene polymorphisms and mutations in BMP pathway genes have been associated with various non-syndromic and syndromic human craniofacial malformations. The identification of intricate cellular interactions and underlying molecular pathways illustrate the importance of local fine-regulation of Bmp signaling to control proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and stem/progenitor differentiation during craniofacial development. Thus, BMP signaling contributes both to shape and functionality of our facial features. BMP signaling also regulates postnatal craniofacial growth and is associated with dental structures life-long. A more detailed understanding of BMP function in growth, homeostasis, and repair of postnatal craniofacial tissues will contribute to our ability to rationally manipulate this signaling network in the context of tissue engineering.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nBmp2fl/fl mice (Graf and Economides 2008) were crossed to Wnt1-Cre mice, Tg(Wnt1-cre)11Rth, for neural crest–specific deletion of Bmp2 (Bmp2ncko). Bmp2lacZ reporter mice, Bmp2tm1(KOMP)Vlcg (Salazar et al. 2016), were used to detect Bmp2 expression. For timed matings, adult mice were mated overnight, and the day of vaginal plug was designated as day 0.5. All animal experiments were approved by the Research Ethics Office of the University of Alberta (Animal Use and Care Committee; protocol AUP1149), in compliance with guidelines by the Canadian Council of Animal Care. Mouse lines were kept on a C57Bl/6J background at the animal facility of the University of Alberta.\n\nA Twsg1 genomic clone was obtained by screening a mouse genomic DNA library using a 2170-bp mouse Twsg1 cDNA probe (XhoI–NotI fragment) containing the entire 666-bp coding region (cDNA clone AW258143 was obtained from Research Genetics). A 16-kb NotI fragment from a positive phage was subcloned into Bluescript II KS+ plasmid. The targeting vector was prepared using pDZ157 plasmid (Raymond et al., 2000) and electroporated into AB1 ES cells. Homologous recombination in G418-resistant ES cell clones was confirmed by PCR analysis of the 5′ region and Southern blot analysis using a 0.9-kb XbaI–AseI 3′probe outside the homologous region. Six of 266 G418-resistant clones were correctly targeted on both the 5′ and 3′ ends. Of the two injected clones, one gave rise to chimeric mice that transmitted the mutation through the germline. Heterozygous mice carrying a conditional allele of Twsg1 (Twsg1neo/+) were bred to βactin-Cre mice (Lewandoski et al., 1997) to remove exon 3. Mice heterozygous for deletion of exon 3 are called Twsg1+/−. Because the presence of the PGKneomycin (PGKneo) cassette may affect the phenotype of the mice, Twsg1+/− mice were also bred to βactin-FLPe mice (Rodriguez et al., 2000) to remove the PGKneo cassette. Heterozygous mice lacking the PGKneo cassette were intercrossed to generate homozygotes.\n\nA null mutation was made in the mouse gene Noggin by replacing the coding sequence with the lacZ gene, deleting all but 10 NH2-terminal residues of Noggin. This null mutation should cause overactivity of BMP proteins, because the BMP antagonist, Noggin, has been removed.\n\nThe Bmp7wt/Δ allele used in this study was derived by deleting a conditional Bmp7wt/flx allele by Cre-mediated recombination in the germline. Bmp7 heterozygous null mice (Bmp7wt/Δ) were intercrossed to obtain Bmp7Δ/Δ embryos and control littermates. Genotyping of embryos was carried out by allele-specific PCR. The Bmp7lacZ allele has been described elsewhere. For conditional deletion, the K14-Cre or wnt1-Cre lines were used. All mouse lines were backcrossed for more than 8 generations into the C57BL/6J background. Mice were maintained at the animal facilities of the University of Zurich. Animal experiments were approved by the local veterinary authorities (permit 98/2011, Veterinäramt Zürich) in compliance with Swiss federal law (TSchG, TSchV) and cantonal by-laws in full compliance with the European Guideline 86/609/EC. \n\nThe study designs for the Alk and Grm mouse models are unpublished.\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA). To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"PN84 PN180 Bmp7+/+ Alk2/3+/+ Alk6+/- Grm1 Bmp2+/+ Grm1+/+ PN427 PN549 tomography Bmp7-/- Alk2/3+/- PN450 Hallgrimsson musculus gene. altered PN214 PN90 PN18 PN190 Grm1+/- head micro-computed female PN32 product Alk6+/+ PN42 PN38 PN77 PN14 Twsg1+/- Bmp2+/- Nog molecular male PN244 PN274 Grm1-/- function PN60 PN110 PN63 Acvr1 Mus Benedikt analysis Twsg1 Nog+/- PN793 PN70 (microCT) Bmp2/7+/- Bmp7NA Bmp7 PN122 PN35 Bmpr1a Morphometric FACEBASE:3-VP6A gene 3-KB46 PN28 PN300 PN107 Alk3+/- null Twsg1+/+ organism A Bmp2/7-/- https://www.facebase.org/id/3-VP6A type PN120 PN76 lacks mutation PN61 PN92 Alk3+/+ PN49 Alk6-/- Nog+/+ Bmp7+/- PN168 Bmp2/7+/+ Bmpr1b wild-type Alk2+/- Bmp2 PN152","RID":"3-KB46","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b4c06232-fced-4530-ba5e-a8fe378ac2a6","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2021-09-27T22:52:21.489636+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/3-KB46","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

Sequencing of Significant Signals from Cleft Lip GWAS. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.\nNonsyndromic cleft lip and palate (NSCL/P) is a complex disorder caused by both genetic and environmental factors and has been the focus of an extensive effort to identify genetic risk factors. A number of candidate gene studies have been performed but have not been widely replicated. To date, four independent genome wide association studies have been performed as well as a meta-analysis. Together these studies have identified many loci associated with NSCL/P. The goal of this project is to use targeted sequencing to further characterize these regions and to progress from the association signals identified by GWAS to the identification of causative genes and/or variants.\n\nThis study is part of the GWASeq project, a collaboration of five disease studies, which will sequence genomic regions from GWAS to characterize the genetic variation underlying these diseases and to compare study design and methods for the follow-up of GWAS studies by sequencing.\n\nThe goal of this study is to sequence 1000+ NSCL/P case-parent trios from China and the Philippines and 400 trios of European ancestry. Targeted sequencing was performed on intervals ranging between 60kb to 1Mb surrounding 13 genes/loci previously associated with NSCL/P including: IRF6, MAFB, ARHGAP29, 8q24, PAX7, VAX1, NTN1, NOG, FOXE1, MSX1, BMP4, FGFR2, PTCH1.\n\nSequencing was performed at the Genome Institute at Washington University.\n\nClick [here](/hgai/OFC2.html)  to access the data and results for this dataset.\n","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"Sequencing and quality control methods were described in Leslie et al.

However, the mechanism underlying root patterning and morphogenesis remains poorly understood. In this study, we find that Lhx6 labels a subpopulation of root progenitor cells in the apical dental mesenchyme, which is closely associated with furcation development. Loss of Lhx6 leads to furcation and root number defects, indicating that Lhx6 is a key root patterning regulator. Among the multiple cellular patterning events regulated by Lhx6 is the odontogenic commitment of progenitor cells, which it controls in a cell-autonomous manner. Specifically, Lhx6 loss leads to elevated Sfrp2 expression and down-regulation of WNT signaling in the furcation region, while overactivation of WNT signaling in Lhx6+ progenitor cells partially restore the furcation defects in Lhx6-/- mice. Collectively, our findings have important implications for understanding organ morphogenesis and future strategies for tooth root regeneration.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"We performed laser capture microdissection of the apical tissues at the furcation development region of both control and mutant mice using the Zeiss PALM Laser Capture Microdissection System.

 {"id":14349,"accession":"FB00001102","title":"Genes and microRNAs associated with mouse cleft palate: A systematic review and bioinformatics analysis","project":328,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"**ABSTRACT:**\nCleft palate (CP) is the most prevalent craniofacial deformity, with ethnic and geographic variation in prevalence in humans. Mice have been used as an animal model to study the cause(s) of CP by several approaches, including genetic and chemical-induced approaches. Mouse genetic approaches revealed that significant amounts of genes are involved in the CP pathology. The aim of this study was to identify common features of CP-associated genes and to explore the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) as important post-transcriptional regulators that may be involved in the regulation of CP genes. To generate an accurate list of genes associated with CP, we first conducted systematic literature searches through main databases such as Medline, Embase, and PubMed, as well as other sources such as Scopus and Mouse Genome Informatics. We found that 195 mouse strains with single-gene mutations and 140 mouse strains with compound-gene mutations were reported to have CP. The CP genes were categorized by functions and pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology annotations, highlighting the contribution of cellular metabolism to CP. A total of 18 miRNAs were involved in the regulation of multiple CP genes. Human genotype-phenotype analysis revealed that variants in five human homologous CP genes (IRF6, FOXE1, VAX1, WNT9B, and GAD1) significantly contributed to the human CP phenotype. Thus, our results suggest that cellular metabolism and miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of genetic pathways and networks crucial for palatal formation.\n\n**REFERENCE DATABASES:**\n- [http://geneontology.org](http://geneontology.org)\n- [https://www.genome.jp/kegg](https://www.genome.jp/kegg)","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Eligibility criteria for the systematic review**\nThe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline and corresponding checklist were followed for this systematic review. Articles included in the systematic review met the following eligibility criteria: 1) described causative genes of mouse CP; 2) were published as original articles (not as review articles, editorials, or comments); 3) were published in English; 4) were published between the years 1980 and 2016; and 5) specified a CP type. Some articles were excluded from the systematic review because of one or more of the following reasons: 1) gene mutations were not described in the original articles; 2) CP was not described; 3) CP was caused by environmental factors; and 4) the articles failed to fit in any of the above criteria but did not have useful CP genes or related information.\n\n**Information sources and search**\nThe online databases searched included Medline (Ovid), PubMed (National Library of Medicine), and EMBASE (Ovid). In addition, relevant citations were searched in Scopus (Elsevier) to retrieve any exceptional studies missed by the database searches. The bibliographies of highly pertinent articles were further examined to avoid any errors introduced with the systematic review. The Primary Excel Workbook designed for systematic reviews (http://libguides.sph.uth.tmc.edu/excel_SR_workbook) was used to track all search strategies and results, as described previously (Davlin and Vonville, 2012. PMID: 22480924). The search was restricted to studies from 1980 to 2016 because mouse genetic studies have only advanced technologically in recent years.\n\n**Study selection and data collection**\nRefWorks (Proquest) was utilized to store all the citations found through the search process. Titles and abstracts of papers found in the database search were screened using the Primary Excel Workbook, as described previously (Sangani et al., 2015. PMID: 27695703). Data related to both screening and reviewing of the full text of articles not excluded were documented in the Primary Excel Workbook. A codebook including citation information, study-level information (characteristics and results), and quality level information was developed for data extraction from eligible articles.\n\n**Gene set enrichment analysis**\nGene set enrichment analysis was conducted using the WebGestalt tool (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt) (Zhang et al., 2005. PMID: 15980575). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg) was used for canonical pathway enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology (GO) database resource (http://www.geneontology.org) was used to identify functional categories of genes that were significantly enriched with CP-associated genes. Significantly enriched functional categories (pathways) were filtered to have a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and at least four CP-associated genes. Here, p-value was calculated using the hypergeometric test. A hierarchical level 4 was used as the cut-off in order to avoid GO terms that were too general.\n\n**MicroRNA-target gene analysis**\nThe miRNA-gene relationships were verified with information from miRTarbase, the experimentally validated miRNA-gene interaction database, and three databases (miRanda, PITA, and TargetScan) of predicted miRNA-gene interactions (Chou et al., 2016. PMID: 26590260; John et al., 2004. PMID: 15502875; Kertesz et al., 2007. PMID: 17893677; Lewis et al., 2005. PMID: 15652477). Fisher's exact test was used to identify statistically significant miRNAs targeting multiple CP genes. The Benjamini–Hochberg method was used for multiple test correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). FDR values were applied for all statistical analyses.","release_date":"2020-07-07","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"data Mus analysis Gad1 Junichi Iwata palate VAX1 IRF6 musculus Wnt9b secondary 1-JVW2 FOXE1","RID":"1-JVW2","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/bdbab89d-1104-40b1-9f2f-33eeef1a3a6d","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2020-05-19T02:23:01.255099+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/1-JVW2","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

Furthermore, it is clear that these components interact and may be transmissible within families. The overarching goal of the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia (COHRA) is to delineate the covariation between genetic, behavioral, family, and community factors associated with oro-dental disease and tooth loss in rural and urban northern Appalachian families (West Virginia and Pennsylvania).  \n\nThe COHRA1 cohort study recruited approximately 800 households.  Inclusion criteria for COHRA1 included households with one biological parent-child pair living together with the child being between ages 1 and 18 years; all members of eligible households were offered admission into the study regardless of biological or legal relationships and regardless of oral health conditions. Exclusion criteria included individuals with neurological impairment, physical or intellectual handicap, or psychosis, and households for which the adult or child of the biological parent-child pair had either a reduced capacity to resist infection or form blood clots due to reasons such as leukemia, cancer, unstable diabetes, transplant, blood clotting disorder, corticosteroid use, immunosuppressive therapy, blood thinning medications, or HIV.\n\nCOHRA1 obtained extensive data on oral health status, behavioral factors, community risk factors, family risk factors, and individual risk factors (including the host genome and the microbiome).   \n\nThis is restricted-access human data. To gain access to this data, you must first go through the [process outlined here](/odocs/data-guidelines/).\n\nThe listing and corresponding checksums of all data files included in this dataset can be found in the [manifest file](https://www.facebase.org/id/3C-50BJ) in the Supplementary Files Section below.

The Periodontal Screening Record (PSR) was used to assess periodontal status in the sextants within the mouth.  Saliva pH and saliva flow were assessed.  The following classes of variables related to health behaviors, family structure and function, and community resources were collected: **Community risk factors**: 1) economic resources, 2) social infrastructure and 3) physical/geospacial topology; **Family risk factors**: 1) domicile quality, 2) family structure, 3) family harmony, 4) caregiver competence, 5) maternal oral heath orientation and 6) adherence to health mitigating facets of Appalachian culture; **Individual risk factors**: 1) psychological effectiveness (self-regulation, self-esteem, internal locus of control, social skill) and 2) level of oral health behaviors.\n\nOral health status was comprehensively evaluated by calibrated research dentists or dental hygienists:  all tooth surfaces were scored to derive DMFS/DMFT scores for all participants.

Molecular genetic studies of orofacial clefts (OFC) by members of this research consortium began in the 1980's, followed by genome-wide linkage studies in the 1990's-early 2000's, and then genome-wide association studies in the 2010's. A rich phenotyping approach was first added to the consortium in 1999 as a project led by Dr. Mary Marazita under a center grant headed by Dr. Jeff Murray. Additional sites were added throughout the 2000's, until multiple populations and a large number of individuals (~12,000) comprise the current study population for genetic studies of OFCs and related subclinical phenotypes—subtle features believed to represent mild manifestations of the same underlying genetic susceptibility responsible for OFCs. As such, their inclusion in case-control and family-based genetic studies can help to clarify and refine the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Information on how to obtain individual level data is available on [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000774.v1.p1).\n\nClick [here](/hgai/OFC4.html) to access the data and results for this dataset.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"Genotyping and quality control methods are available on dbGaP and are briefly described in Leslie et al. “[A genome-wide association study of nonsyndromic cleft palate identifies an etiologic missense variant in GRHL3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4833215/)”.

This project includes separate datasets and analyses for each surface type separately in primary and permanent dentition. This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative ([GENEVA](https://www.genome.gov/27541319/gene-environment-association-studes-geneva/)), which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI).

In the US, the prevalence in adults is approximately 90% (Beltran-Aguilar et al., 2005), and in some high-risk populations, the prevalence is even higher. Treatment of dental caries consumes significant resources each year, and untreated caries lesions can lead to pain, tooth loss, and oral infection, or other co-morbidities. Cariogenemis is affected by numerous environmental, behavioral, and genetic factors, including dietary behaviors, bacterial flora, fluoride exposure, salivary factors, tooth morphology, etc. (Hunter, 1988; Anderson, 2002). Recent work suggests that the effects of genetic factors on dental caries may differ between pit-and-fissure (PF) and smooth (SM) tooth surfaces (Shaffer et al., 2012b). It has also been well-established that PF surfaces exhibit much greater risk of developing caries lesions than do SM surfaces (Batchelor and Sheiham, 2004; Shaffer et al., 2012a,b), and progression of decay varies between these surface types.\n\nClick [here](/hgai/DENT3.html) to access the data and results for this dataset.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"Participants were drawn from two studies: the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia (**COHRA**) [Polk et al., 2008] and the Iowa Fluoride Study (**IFS**) [Levy et al., 2003]. Iowa Fluoride Study data were used only for the study of primary dentition.\n\nAll tooth surfaces were scored based on visual inspection by dental experts who were calibrated across study sites annually. The traditional caries indices of _dfs_ and _DMFS_ were partitioned to generate separate phenotypes for smooth surfaces (SM) and pit-and-fissure surfaces (PF).\n\nFor permanent dentition, linear regression was used to model additive genetic effects. PF surface analysis was adjusted for the covariates age, sex, and the presence or absence of _Streptococcus mutans_. SM-surface analysis was adjusted for the covariates age, education group (i.e., up to high school, some college, four- year degree or beyond), and the presence or absence of _Streptococcus mutans_. Covariates were determined by a forward selection strategy. Association between PF- or SM-surface caries scores and each SNP was tested. For primary dentition, covariates were age and age squared; meta-analysis was used to combine **COHRA** with two sub-samples of **IFS** that were genotyped separately.

 {"id":14459,"accession":"FB00001209","title":"Shh: A standardized mouse morphology dataset for MusMorph","project":343,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"_This dataset contains processed micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available), all of which were generated for MusMorph. These data were derived from the Shh source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) A dynamic Shh expression pattern, regulated by SHH and BMP signaling, coordinates fusion of primordia in the amniote face:**\n\nThe mechanisms of morphogenesis are not well understood, yet shaping structures during development is essential for establishing correct organismal form and function. Here, Hu et al. (2015) examine mechanisms that help to shape the developing face during the crucial period of facial primordia fusion. This period of development is a time when the faces of amniote embryos exhibit the greatest degree of similarity, and it probably results from the necessity for fusion to occur to establish the primary palate. Their results show that hierarchical induction mechanisms, consisting of iterative signaling by Sonic hedgehog (SHH) followed by Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), regulate a dynamic expression pattern of Shh in the ectoderm covering the frontonasal (FNP) and maxillary (MxP) processes. Furthermore, this Shh expression domain contributes to the morphogenetic processes that drive the directional growth of the globular process of the FNP toward the lateral nasal process and MxP, in part by regulating cell proliferation in the facial mesenchyme. The nature of the induction mechanism that we discovered suggests that the process of fusion of the facial primordia is intrinsically buffered against producing maladaptive morphologies, such as clefts of the primary palate, because there appears to be little opportunity for variation to occur during expansion of the Shh expression domain in the ectoderm of the facial primordia. Ultimately, these results might explain why this period of development constitutes a phylotypic stage of facial development among amniotes.\n\n**(2) Quantitative analyses link modulation of sonic hedgehog signaling to continuous variation in facial growth and shape:**\n\nVariation is an intrinsic feature of biological systems, yet developmental biology does not frequently address population-level phenomena. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling activity in the vertebrate forebrain and face is thought to contribute to continuous variation in the morphology of the upper jaw, but despite its potential explanatory power, this idea has never been quantitatively assessed. Here, Young et al. (2010) test this hypothesis with an experimental design that is explicitly focused on the generation and measurement of variation in multivariate shape, tissue growth, cellular behavior and gene expression. The authors show that the majority of upper jaw shape variation can be explained by progressive changes in the spatial organization and mitotic activity of midfacial growth zones controlled by SHH signaling. In addition, nonlinearity between our treatment doses and phenotypic outcomes suggests that threshold effects in SHH signaling may play a role in variability in midfacial malformations such as holoprosencephaly (HPE). Together, these results provide novel insight into the generation of facial morphology, and demonstrate the value of quantifying variation for our understanding of development and disease.\n\nThe Shh dataset is based on multiple target genes in the Shh pathway, including [Shh](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:98297), [Disp1](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:1916147), and [Hhat](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:2444681).","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nMouse embryos were harvested at E10.5 and E11.5. All embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in a graded series of methanol and stored at −20°C until analysis. The experiments conform to institutional and national regulatory standards that are applied for analysis of vertebrate embryos. Affi-Gel Blue beads (70-140 mesh, 100-200 μm diameter; Bio-Rad) were rinsed four times in PBS and manually selected for uniform size. Beads were soaked in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), recombinant human BMP4 (4 μg/ml with 0.1% BSA; R&D Systems), recombinant human Noggin-N (250 μg/ml with 0.1% BSA; R&D Systems) or recombinant SHH-N (400 μg/ml with 0.1% BSA; Ontogeny) for ≥1 h at 37°C. Prior to initiating experiments, the authors performed a dose-response experiment for BMP4 to determine a dose that did not induce apoptosis.

Several potential mechanisms can be envisioned that would result in CL/P, including failure of prominence growth and/or alignment as well as a failure of fusion of the juxtaposed epithelial seams. Here, Green et al. (2015) analyzed facial outgrowth and shape change over time in a novel mouse model exhibiting fully penetrant bilateral CL/P. This robust model is based upon mutations in [Tfap2a](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:104671), the gene encoding transcription factor AP-2α, which has been implicated in both syndromic and non-syndromic human CL/P. \n\nThe Ap2 dataset is closely related to the Fgf dataset.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nMice were maintained on an outbred Black Swiss background (Charles River, Wilmington, MA).

To obtain Neo/Null embryos that were also heterozygous for Fgf8, female Neo homozygote animals were crossed with Tfap2a+/−; Fgf8+/− male mice. The Fgf8 null allele was derived by crossing the Fgf8flox line, Fgf8tm1.3Mrt, with β-actin Cre transgenic mice (Meyers et al., 1998), and then crossing back to Black Swiss mice to remove the β-actin Cre transgene.

However, the effect of epistatic interactions on the development of complex traits, such as craniofacial morphology, is poorly understood. We use the morphometric landmarks associated with a previous FaceBase analysis (Genetic Determinants of Orofacial Shape and Relationship to Cleft Lip/Palate) to 1) quantify the effect of three Sprouty null mutations on craniofacial shape and 2) to quantify how the associated dysmorphology is modulated by three inbred backgrounds. While it is commonly known that a given mutation may have different phenotypic effects across mouse backgrounds, our quantitative results represent an important first step towards elucidating genetic interactions underlying variation in robustness to known genetic perturbations in mice. Taking background effects into account will be necessary to identify genetic and developmental interactions that modulate the severity of craniofacial dysmorphology, because variation in the penetrance or severity of a disease mutation among humans is almost certainly based on similar interactions. In addition, identical micro-CT image and landmarking protocols make this a valuable comparative dataset to the Collaborative Cross mouse dataset of adult mouse morphology already found on FaceBase.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":null,"release_date":"2017-04-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"Spry2 Mus Benedikt Mutation Abnormal skull bone TKJ https://www.facebase.org/id/1-4FMG description (microCT) imaging assay micro-computed morphology Spry1 Klein tomography Ophir Spry4 Hallgrimsson FACEBASE:1-4FMG musculus Null No craniofacial","RID":"TKJ","RCB":null,"RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2017-09-23T00:33:18.797126+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/TKJ","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

One of these cell types, the osteoclast, has not been well studied in the context of normal bone development in the craniofacial space. Our aim in generating this series of imaging data was to create an atlas of the distribution of osteoclast cells in the skull during critical periods of development. Through the use of daily low-magnification live confocal imaging on juvenile zebrafish we were able to track osteoclasts in individual fish over time.

The hope was to be able to show the clustering of the osteoclast cell type around specific areas, something that we saw with the daily live imaging but wanted to show was a pattern across individuals.

Mutations are the raw material for evolution, yet robustness to their effects is required for species survival. The mechanisms that produce robustness are poorly understood. Nonlinearities are a ubiquitous feature of development that may link variation in development to phenotypic robustness. Here, we manipulate the gene dosage of a signaling molecule, Fgf8, a critical regulator of vertebrate development. We demonstrate that variation in Fgf8 expression has a nonlinear relationship to phenotypic variation, predicting levels of robustness among genotypes. Differences in robustness are not due to gene expression variance or dysregulation, but emerge from the nonlinearity of the genotype–phenotype curve. In this instance, embedded features of development explain robustness differences. How such features vary in natural populations and relate to genetic variation are key questions for unraveling the origin and evolvability of this feature of organismal development.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"The Fgf8neo series is a 5 member series generated from a combination of the neomycin insertion into the intron between exons 2 and 3 of the Fgf8 locus and a null allele generated from loss of exon 2.

Both series of Fgf8 mice were generated from the Fgf8 flp/ floxed allele originally developed by Meyers et al. To generate the floxed allele for the CRECT studies, the neomycin resistance cassette was removed by crossing these mice to β-actin-flp (B6.CgTg (ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J), generating the floxed allele. Deletion constructs were developed by crossing with β-actin Cre (FVB/N-Tg(ACTB-cre)2Mrt/J), to delete exons 2 and 3 from all cells. \n\nThe neo cassette was maintained in the Fgf8Neo mice.

Through low-magnification live confocal imaging on size-matched juvenile zebrafish, we generated merged images of osteoclast distribution overlaid on a representative image of bone structure.

These data were derived from the Diversity Outbred (DO) source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) The diversity outbred mouse population:**\n\nThe Diversity Outbred (DO) population is a heterogeneous stock derived from the same eight founder strains as the Collaborative Cross (CC) inbred strains. Genetically heterogeneous DO mice display a broad range of phenotypes. Natural levels of heterozygosity provide genetic buffering and, as a result, DO mice are robust and breed well. Genetic mapping analysis in the DO presents new challenges and opportunities. Specialized algorithms are required to reconstruct haplotypes from high-density SNP array data. The eight founder haplotypes can be combined into 36 possible diplotypes, which must be accommodated in QTL mapping analysis. Population structure of the DO must be taken into account here. Estimated allele effects of eight founder haplotypes provide information that is not available in two-parent crosses and can dramatically reduce the number of candidate loci. Allele effects can also distinguish chance colocation of QTL from pleiotropy, which provides a basis for establishing causality in expression QTL studies. Churchill et al. (2012) recommended sample sizes of 200–800 mice for QTL mapping studies, larger than for traditional crosses. The CC inbred strains provide a resource for independent validation of DO mapping results. Genetic heterogeneity of the DO can provide a powerful advantage in our ability to generalize conclusions to other genetically diverse populations. Genetic diversity can also help to avoid the pitfall of identifying an idiosyncratic reaction that occurs only in a limited genetic context. Informatics tools and data resources associated with the CC, the DO, and their founder strains are developing rapidly. The authors anticipate a flood of new results to follow as the community begins to adopt and utilize these new genetic resource populations.\n\n**(2) Facial shape and allometry quantitative trait locus intervals in the Diversity Outbred mouse are enriched for known skeletal and facial development genes:**\n\nThe biology of how faces are built and come to differ from one another is complex. Discovering normal variants that contribute to differences in facial morphology is one key to untangling this complexity, with important implications for medicine and evolutionary biology. This study maps quantitative trait loci (QTL) for skeletal facial shape using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. The DO is a randomly outcrossed population with high heterozygosity that captures the allelic diversity of eight inbred mouse lines from three subspecies. The study uses a sample of 1147 DO animals (the largest sample yet employed for a shape QTL study in mouse), each characterized by 22 three-dimensional landmarks, 56,885 autosomal and X-chromosome markers, and sex and age classifiers. Katz et al. (2020) identified 37 facial shape QTL across 20 shape principal components (PCs) using a mixed effects regression that accounts for kinship among observations. The QTL include some previously identified intervals as well as new regions that expand the list of potential targets for future experimental study. Three QTL characterized shape associations with size (allometry). Median support interval size was 3.5 Mb. Narrowing additional analysis to QTL for the five largest magnitude shape PCs, the authors found significant overrepresentation of genes with known roles in growth, skeletal and facial development, and sensory organ development. For most intervals, one or more of these genes lies within 0.25 Mb of the QTL’s peak. QTL effect sizes were small, with none explaining more than 0.5% of facial shape variation. These results are consistent with a model of facial diversity that is influenced by key genes in skeletal and facial development and, simultaneously, is highly polygenic.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nThe DO (Svenson et al. 2012) is a heterogeneous stock derived from the same eight founder strains as the Collaborative Cross inbred strains (Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012). In 2009, animals representing 144 independent lineages from the CC breeding colony at The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Chesler et al. 2008) were used to seed the DO population, which was then maintained as a randomized breeding colony with a population size of 175 pairs. One female and one male from each first litter are randomly assigned to a new breeding pair to make the next generation. This mating scheme doubles the effective population size and minimizes the effects of drift and selection on allele frequencies in the DO (Rockman and Kruglyak 2008; unpublished simulations). Each DO mouse is a unique individual with a high level of allelic heterozygosity, and the DO population provides an effectively unlimited source of novel allelic combinations. Generation 10 was expected to have an average of 390 recombination events per animal, sufficient to provide sub-Mb mapping resolution, and mapping resolution will continue to improve with each successive generation. MusMorph now has 27 generations of the DO.\n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA). To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"PN156 PN279 PN420 Mus DO10 PN84 analysis Benedikt PN145 PN52 DO15 (microCT) PN91 PN98 PN150 tomography PN152 PN105 Morphometric PN141 PN159 Hallgrimsson PN137 PN140 musculus DO27 DO19 PN157 PN139 PN146 PN149 PN153 organism DO21 DO9 PN132 DO23 head PN155 micro-computed PN65 female PN142 PN282 PN50 PN272 PN154 PN135 PN147 DO male PN143 PN281 PN113 PN274 3-KB4P PN160","RID":"3-KB4P","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b4c06232-fced-4530-ba5e-a8fe378ac2a6","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2021-09-28T02:34:21.5735+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/3-KB4P","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

Lhx6 is consistently and specifically expressed in the dental mesenchyme in mice after birth. Unexpectedly, despite the fact that Lhx6 is broadly expressed in dental mesenchyme during embryonic tooth crown development, it labels a subpopulation of Gli1+ root progenitor cells in the apical dental mesenchyme during postnatal root development. The progeny of this Lhx6+ cell subpopulation is closely associated with root furcation development, and loss of Lhx6 results in root furcation and number of defects. Mechanistically, Lhx6 regulates tooth root patterning and morphogenesis through coordinating key cellular events including mesenchymal proliferation and differentiation as well as dental epithelial elongation.

Images at a resolution of 16.7 μm were acquired with the X-ray source at 50kVp and 800µA. The reconstruction of 3D images was completed using Avizo/Amira 9.5.0 (FEI Visualization Sciences Group, France).\n\n**Histology assay**\nMouse mandibles were dissected and fixed in 10% neutralized buffered formalin (NBF, Sigma) overnight at room temperature, then decalcified with 10% EDTA in 1xPBS for 1-14 days based on mouse age. Decalcified mandibles were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Tissue blocks were sectioned at 5μm using a microtome (Leica) and mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was completed following standard protocols.\n\n**Immunofluorescence assay**\nImmunofluorescence assays were performed on paraffin-embedded sections prepared as described above. Sections were dried for 1 hour at 55oC, deparaffinized and rehydrated. After antigen retrieval (Vector, H-3300), sections were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in blocking solution (PerkinElmer, FP1020), and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution at 4°C overnight. After washing three times with PBST (0.1% Tween20 in 1xPBS), sections were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. DAPI (Sigma, D9542) was used for nuclear staining. Detailed information on antibodies used in this study is available in S1Table.\n\n**In situ RNAscope assay**\nTissues were fixed in 10% NBF overnight at room temperature, decalcified with DEPC-treated 10% EDTA in 1×PBS at 4oC, dehydrated sequentially with 15% sucrose in 1xPBS (4oC, overnight) and 30% sucrose in 1xPBS/OCT (4oC, overnight), and embedded in OCT (Sakura, Tissue-Tek, 4583) on liquid nitrogen immediately.

With the advent of affordable, non-invasive 3D surface imaging technology, it is now possible to capture detailed quantitative information about the face in a large number of individuals. By coupling state- of-the-art 3D imaging with advances in high-throughput genotyping, an unparalleled opportunity exists to map the genetic determinants of normal facial variation. The project contains the results of GWAS performed on 3D facial measurements from two cohorts of US Caucasians collected as part of the FaceBase consortium.

(2016).\n\nClick [here](/hgai/FV1.html) to access the data and results for this dataset.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"The sample for this study consisted of 3118 individuals of European ancestry belonging to two US cohorts: the “Pittsburgh” cohort (2447 participants, aged 3-49 years, largely recruited as part of the [3D Facial Norms](https://www.facebase.org/facial_norms/) project). The “Denver” cohort included 671 participants, aged 3-12 years, recruited as part of Facebase project “Genetic Determinants of Orofacial Shape and Relationship to Cleft Lip/Palate” (PI: Richard A. Spritz). Each participant had his or her facial surface captured using 3D stereophotogrammetry using either the 3dMD imaging system (Pittsburgh) or Creaform Gemini system (Denver). Landmarking of facial surfaces was completed manually (Pittsburgh) or with an automated landmarking approach [https://www.facebase.org/facial_landmarking](https://www.facebase.org/facial_landmarking/). Additional details on recruitment and phenotyping can be found in Shaffer et al. (2016) and on the [FaceBase](https://www.facebase.org/) website.\n\nPrior to genetic association analysis, each of the 20 linear distance measures was adjusted for the effects of sex, age, age2, height, weight, and facial size (calculated as the geometric mean of the linear distance measures) using linear regression. Linear models were then used to test genetic association between each adjusted phenotype (i.e., residuals) and each SNP, under the additive genetic model, while simultaneously adjusting for the first four principal components of ancestry. Analyses were performed separately in the Pittsburgh and Denver cohorts, and combined via inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. In order to appropriately model SNP effects, we required that the minor allele be present in at least 30 participants. This corresponds to a minor allele frequency threshold of 0.6% in the Pittsburgh cohort and 2% in the Denver cohort. SNPs meeting the minor allele count criterion in both Pittsburgh and Denver cohorts were included in the meta-analysis.","release_date":"2019-07-02","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"BeadChip: Upper Lower mouth v1.0 analysis face Single Lip Subnasal wide nucleotide (SNP) panel meta Intercanthal Association Outercanthal Human610-Quad Marazita lip Homo Depth Study Ala Illumina nose Width Bridge Fissure polymorphism Mary organism Protrusion genotyping Left Height Base sapiens Genome Right Morphological Nasal head association female FaceDepth eye Labial Philtrum (GWAS) Length male Cranial L.

Cell-cell interactions within the stem cell niche are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, the niche cells supporting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are largely unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show heterogeneity among Gli1+ MSCs and identify a subpopulation of Runx2+/Gli1+ cells in the adult mouse incisor. These Runx2+/Gli1+ cells are strategically located between MSCs and transit amplifying cells (TACs). They are not stem cells, but help to maintain the MSC niche via IGF signaling to regulate TAC proliferation, differentiation, and incisor growth rate. ATAC-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that Runx2 directly binds to Igfbp3 in the MSC niche. This Runx2-mediated IGF signaling cascade is crucial for regulating the MSC niche and maintaining tissue homeostasis to support continuous growth of the adult mouse incisor, providing a model for analysis of the molecular regulation of MSC niche. \n\n","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**scRNA Sequencing**\n\nFour-week-old wildtype C57BL/6J mice were used for single-cell transcriptomics experiments. Mandibles were carefully dissected under a stereomicroscope. The surrounding jaw bones were removed by scalpel and the proximal region was then severed. Dental pulp with dental epithelium was isolated, cut into pieces, collected in cold PBS, and digested with 2mg/ml collagenase type I (Worthington, LS004194) dissolved in α-MEM (Gibco, 12571-048) for 30 min at 37 ℃. After incubation, the suspension was homogenized by pipetting and digestion was terminated by adding 10% FBS. The digested tissues were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min and resuspended in 10% FBS. Twenty thousand cells were loaded into the 10X Chromium system with targeted cell recovery of 10,000 cells to be barcoded for scRNA-seq using a Single Cell 3’ Library Kit v3. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina Novaseq System. About 9,318 cells (~63,000 reads per cells) were successfully barcoded and their transcriptomes sequenced. Raw read counts were analyzed using the Seurat R package (Satija et al., 2015).\n\n**ATAC-sequencing**\n\nThe proximal dental mesenchyme of mouse incisor was dissected from 4-week-old wild type C57BL/6J mice. A cell suspension was prepared as described above for scRNA sequencing. Five thousand cells were obtained, spun down, and washed once with cold PBS. Then the cells were resuspended in cold lysis buffer. The transposition reaction, purification and PCR application followed a previously described protocol (Buenrostro et al., 2015). Transposed DNA libraries were sequenced on NextSeq500 High-Output 150 cycles (75PE). ATAC-seq reads were aligned to the UCSC mm10 reference genome with BWA-MEM(Li, 2013). ATAC-seq peaks were called through MACS2 (Zhang et al., 2008). Peaks were annotated and known transcription factor binding motifs were further analyzed in the ATAC-seq peaks by HOMER (Heinz et al., 2010).\n\n**RNA sequencing**\n\nIncisor samples taken one week after induction of one-month-old Gli1-CreERT2;Runx2fl/fl and Runx2fl/fl mice were dissected. The proximal region was collected for RNA isolation with an RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). The quality of RNA samples was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and all samples used for sequencing had RNA integrity (RIN) numbers >9.0. cDNA library preparation and sequencing were performed by DNA Link, Inc. Single-end reads with 75 cycles were performed on NextSeq500 for three pairs of samples. Raw reads were trimmed, aligned using STAR (version 2.6.1d) with the mm10 genome, and normalized using Upper quartile. Differential expression was calculated by selecting transcripts that had significant changes of P<0.05.\n","release_date":"2020-12-14","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"Mus Novaseq Runx2 2) important 5 bone assay Control 150 ATAC-seq PN weeks well 500 role mandible Illumina musculus development. high-output Gli1-creERT2;Runx2fl/fl transcription (scRNA-seq) Yang 1-RK82 single-cell factor system Chromium FACEBASE:1-RK8Y RNA-seq tooth NextSeq encodes Chai known (Runt-related 4 https://www.facebase.org/id/1-RK8Y 10X","RID":"1-RK82","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/93416595-2bc4-42a8-b5b9-9b7c6fdc1d89","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2020-07-09T18:45:53.629017+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/1-RK82","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA\nThis study from the University of Pittsburgh’s [Center for Craniofacial and Dental Genetics](https://www.dental.pitt.edu/center-craniofacial-and-dental-genetics) provides an opportunity to investigate the genetics of orofacial clefts (OFCs) in one set of families ascertained in Guatemala. Orofacial clefts (OFCs), particularly cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and isolated cleft palate (CP) are a major public health problem, affecting one in every 500-1000 births worldwide thus representing the most common facial birth defect and one of the most common of all congenital anomalies. CL/P is a major structural birth defect that is notable for significant lifelong morbidity and complex etiology. The extensive psychological, surgical, speech and dental involvement emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying causes of CL/P. Therefore, many research groups have attempted to elucidate the etiology of CL/P, with some recent success by our research group and others (see Beaty et al., 2010, 2011; Dixon et al., 2011). It is clear that CL/P can occur as part of Mendelian syndromes, that certain chromosomal abnormalities include CL/P in the phenotype, and that certain teratogens can increase the risk of having an offspring with CL/P. However, phenotypes of known etiology comprise only a small portion of all individuals with a CL/P or CP, and the major focus of research into OFCs is to develop an understanding of the etiology of nonsyndromic (NS) forms of clefting. \n\nThis study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative ([GENEVA](https://www.genome.gov/27541319/gene-environment-association-studes-geneva/)), which was developed through the trans-NIH Genes, Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). A genome-wide panel of 610,000 SNPs was genotyped at the Broad Institute to be comparable to our other pertinent GENEVA studies that are also part of dbGaP (dbGaP accession number phs000095, \"Dental Caries: Whole Genome Association and Gene x Environment Studies\" and dbGaP accession number phs000094, \"International Consortium to Identify Genes and Interactions Controlling Oral Clefts\"). The goal of this study is to investigate genetic determinants to OFCs in a novel study population. To date, most genetic studies of OFCs in Caucasians and Asians. The Guatemalan population under study is rural and ethnically mixed with a high proportion of Native-South-Americans. Thirty-six Guatemalans from this dataset were also part of the recent GWAS studies of cleft lip and cleft palate (Beaty et al., 2010 and 2011, dbGaP Study Accession: phs000094, \"International Consortium to Identify Genes and Interactions Controlling Oral Clefts\"). Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The study was supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR, U01-DE018903). Data cleaning and harmonization were done at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.\n\nInformation on how to obtain individual level data is available on [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000440.v1.p1).\n\nClick [here](/hgai/OFC3.html) to access the data and results for this dataset.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"Genotyping and quality control methods are available on dbGaP and are briefly described in Wolf et al.

 {"id":14462,"accession":"FB00001212","title":"Strain Comparison: A standardized mouse morphology dataset for MusMorph","project":343,"funding":null,"summary":null,"description":"_This dataset contains processed micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available), all of which were generated for MusMorph. These data were derived from the Strain_Comparison source data._\n\n**Selected abstract(s):**\n\n**(1) Spatial packing, cranial base angulation, and craniofacial shape variation in the mammalian skull -- testing a new model using mice:**\n\nThe hypothesis that variation in craniofacial shape within and among species is influenced by spatial packing has a long history in comparative anatomy, particularly in terms of primates. This study develops and tests three alternative models of spatial packing to address how and to what extent the cranial base angle is influenced by variation in brain and facial size. The models are tested using mouse strains with different mutations affecting craniofacial growth. Although mice have distinctive crania with small brains, long faces, and retroflexed cranial bases, the results of the study indicate that the mouse cranial base flexes to accommodate larger brain size relative to cranial base length. In addition, the mouse cranial base also extends, but to a lesser degree, to accommodate larger face size relative to cranial base length. Interactions between brain size, face size, and the widths and lengths of the components of the cranial base account for a large percentage of variation in cranial base angle. The results illustrate the degree to which the cranial base is centrally embedded within the covariation structure of the craniofacial complex as a whole.\n\n**(2) Epigenetic integration of the developing brain and face:**\n\nThe integration of the brain and face and to what extent this relationship constrains or enables evolutionary change in the craniofacial complex is an issue of long-standing interest in vertebrate evolution. To investigate brain-face integration, Parsons et al. (2011) studied the covariation between the forebrain and midface at gestational days 10–10.5 in four strains of laboratory mice. The authors found that phenotypic variation in the forebrain is highly correlated with that of the face during face formation such that variation in the size of the forebrain correlates with the degree of prognathism and orientation of the facial prominences. This suggests strongly that the integration of the brain and face is relevant to the etiology of midfacial malformations such as orofacial clefts. This axis of integration also has important implications for the evolutionary developmental biology of the mammalian craniofacial complex. \n\n**(3) Deciphering the palimpsest -- studying the relationship between morphological integration and phenotypic covariation:**\n\nOrganisms represent a complex arrangement of anatomical structures and individuated parts that must maintain functional associations through development. This integration of variation between functionally related body parts and the modular organization of development are fundamental determinants of their evolvability. This is because integration results in the expression of coordinated variation that can create preferred directions for evolutionary change, while modularity enables variation in a group of traits or regions to accumulate without deleterious effects on other aspects of the organism. Using work on both model systems (e.g., lab mice, avians) and natural populations of rodents and primates, Hallgrimsson et al. (2009) explore in this paper the relationship between patterns of phenotypic covariation and the developmental determinants of integration that those patterns are assumed to reflect. The authors show that integration cannot be reliably studied through phenotypic covariance patterns alone and argue that the relationship between phenotypic covariation and integration is obscured in two ways. One is the superimposition of multiple determinants of covariance in complex systems and the other is the dependence of covariation structure on variances in covariance-generating processes.","mouse_genetic":null,"human_anatomic":null,"study_design":"**Mouse breeding and generation:**\n\nEach of the above strain comparison studies were conducted with a mixed comparative and experimental research design using a variety of mouse mutants and wild types that vary considerably in overall craniofacial shape. For these comparative analyses, the authors used crania from up to 19 genetic backgrounds, including mutants that vary considerably in craniofacial shape. This sample includes both variation of unknown developmental origin as well as variation in known factors such as brain size and chondrocranial growth. \n\n**Preparation and imaging:**\n\nAdult mouse carcasses were stored at -20°C after euthanasia. Prior to the day of scanning, the mouse was retrieved and thawed overnight at 4°C. All crania were micro-CT scanned (Scanco Viva-CT40) at 35 µm resolution (70 kV, 160 µA). To standardize the data for MusMorph, these scans were resampled (i.e. reoriented and sampled to the same resolution) to a common atlas space.","release_date":"2021-11-05","show_in_jbrowse":null,"_keywords":"Mus E11.5 analysis C57BL/10J PN86 PN229 Benedikt PN88 PN183 (microCT) CBA/J PN427 PN305 PN458 tomography PN122 A/WySnJ A/J Morphometric PN396 Hallgrimsson PN137 musculus PN107 FVB/NJ PN90 organism head C57BL/6J female BALB/c DBA/J 3-JZ9J C3H/HeJ micro-computed PN168 PN198 male PN244 PN152","RID":"3-JZ9J","RCB":"https://auth.globus.org/b4c06232-fced-4530-ba5e-a8fe378ac2a6","RMB":"https://www.facebase.org/webauthn_robot/fb_cron","RCT":"2021-09-24T18:25:25.671894+00:00","RMT":"2023-11-10T04:03:34.894671+00:00","released":true,"Requires_DOI?":true,"DOI":"10.25550/3-JZ9J","protected_human_subjects":false,"cellbrowser_uri":null},

Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays important role in tooth root formation. Wnt5a ligand, one component of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, is associated with tooth development. However, its function during root formation is still unknown. The aim of this project is to investigate if mesenchyme- and epithelium-derived non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates tooth root development. Epithelial-specific deletion of Ror2 at E14.5 has no effects on root formation. Mesenchymal- and epithelial-specific loss-of-function of Ror2 in the apical region at PN3.5 caused a mild phenotype with a little shorter root. However, loss of Ror2 in dental mesenchyme resulted in a much shorter root with decreased odontoblast differentiation at PN21.5. These data indicate that loss of Ror2 in dental mesenchyme inhibits postnatal root development.

Three-dimensional reconstruction was done using AVIZO 9.5 (Visualization Sciences Group).\n\n**Histological Analysis**\nSamples were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C and decalcified in 10% EDTA (pH 7.5) at 4°C for 1-3 weeks depending on the age of samples. Then samples were processed into paraffin-embedded serial sections at 5 µm using a microtome (Leica). For general morphology, deparaffinized sections were stained with H&E using standard procedures.\n\nFor cryosections, decalcified samples were dehydrated in 15% and 60% sucrose/DEPC-treated PBS solution overnight at 4°C.
